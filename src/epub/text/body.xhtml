<p class="ti0"><span class="smcap">The author</span> of <i>Lazarillo
de Tormes</i> was a scion of one of the noblest families of Spain, and
some account of it should precede a notice of the author’s life.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1" id="FNanchor_1">[1]</a></p>
<p>Don Diego Lopez, Lord of Mendoza, in 1170 married Doña Eleanor
Hurtado, heiress of Mendibil. She was the daughter of Fernan Perez de
Lara called Hurtado, son of Pedro Gonzalez de Lara and of the Queen
Urraca of Castille and Leon.</p>
<p>Don Lopez and Eleanor Hurtado had four sons: Inigo, Lord of Mendoza;
Diego, Lord of Mendibil; Pedro Diaz, who was ancestor of the Mendozas
of Seville; and Fernando, who founded the line in Portugal.</p>
<p>Inigo Lopez de Mendoza married Maria de Haro, and was father of
Maria, the wife of her first cousin, Juan de Mendoza, son of her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xvi">[p. xvi]</span> uncle Diego. Their son,
Diego Hurtado de Mendoza, in the time of Fernando II., married Maria
Gonzalez de Aguero, and had a son Gonzalo.</p>
<p>This Gonzalo Hurtado de Mendoza married Juana Fernandez de Orozco,
and was the father of a very distinguished son—of Pedro Gonzalez.</p>
<p><span class="sidenote">A Mendoza saved<br/>the life of King<br/>Juan I. of
Castille.</span>Pedro Gonzalez Hurtado de Mendoza married Aldonza,
daughter of Fernan Perez de Ayala. He was with Juan I., of Castille, at
the battle of Aljubarrota. In the flight the King’s horse was killed.
Mendoza dismounted and said to the King:—</p>
<div class="poem mt1"><div class="stanza">

<p class="i0">Subid Rey en mi cavallo.</p>
</div></div>
<p class="mt1">The King rode away. Mendoza was overtaken and slain. The
date of the battle was August 14, 1385. His father survived him, dying
in 1405.</p>
<p>The son of this chivalrous knight and successor to his grandfather
was Diego Hurtado de Mendoza, married first to Maria, daughter of
Enrique II., King of Castille, and secondly to Eleanor de la Vega. His
son, Inigo Lopez, was by his second wife.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_xvii">[p. xvii]</span></p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The Poet Marquis<br/>of
Santillana.</span>Inigo Lopez Hurtado de Mendoza was born in 1396.
He served with distinction at the battle of Olmedo, and was created
Marquis of Santillana in 1445. He was opposed to Alvaro de Luna, the
famous Minister of Juan II.</p>
<p>Born in the Asturias, the Marquis was a poet. Among his writings was
a little <i>Serranilla</i>.</p>

<h3>DON DIEGO HURTADO DE MENDOZA, AUTHOR OF “LAZARILLO DE TORMES”</h3>
</div>
<p class="ti0"><span class="smcap">Don Diego Hurtado de Mendoza</span>
was the fifth son of the Marquis of Mondejar and Count of Tendilla,
first Spanish Governor of Granada, by Francisca Pacheco, daughter of
the Duke of Escalona.</p>
<p>The Governor had a palace in the Alhambra near the Torre de Picos,
which is now demolished. But the smaller house of his esquire, Antasio
de Bracamonte, still stands in a garden, built against the exquisite
little mosque on the walls. There are three shields of arms carved on
the walls of Bracamonte’s house.</p>
<p>The palace and the esquire’s house, both within the walls of the
Alhambra, looked across the valley of the Darro to the Albaicín.
Both buildings were surrounded by gardens and fruit-trees. <span class="sidenote">Birth of Don<br/>Diego in the<br/>Alhambra.</span>
In this romantic spot Diego was born in the year 1503, and he passed
his early years with his brothers and sisters there. Pedro<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxiv">[p. xxiv]</span> Martir de Angleria
was his tutor. At an early age he went to the university of
Salamanca, where he learnt Latin, Greek, and Arabic, and studied
canon and civil law.</p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Don Diego at<br/>Salamanca.</span>While he
was a student at Salamanca Don Diego wrote <i>Lazarillo de Tormes</i>.</p>
<p>On leaving the university Don Diego went to serve with the
Spanish armies in Italy. <span class="sidenote">His services<br/>in
Italy.</span> He also attended lectures at Rome, Bologna, and Padua,
and was a profound scholar as well as a statesman and a soldier.
Charles V. appreciated his ability and his acquirements. In 1538,
at the age of thirty-five, he was appointed Ambassador at Venice.
He assisted and patronised the Aldi, and Josephus was first printed
complete from his library. Afterwards he was for some time Military
Governor of Sienna; and he was sent to the Council of Trent to
maintain the imperial interests there. His next employment was at
Rome, as special Plenipotentiary to rebuke and overawe Pope Julius
III., which he did.</p>
<p>Don Diego Hurtado de Mendoza returned to Spain in 1554 at the
age of fifty. <span class="sidenote">The library.</span> He was not
appreciated by Philip II. and seldom came to Court, living,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxv">[p. xxv]</span> with his splendid
library, in his house at Granada.</p>
<p>In his retirement he wrote a good deal of poetry. But his great
work was the <i>Guerra de Granada</i>, a narrative of the rebellion of
the Moors in 1568-1570. <span class="sidenote">The <i>Guerra<br/>de
Granada</i>.</span> He did the Moors such impartial justice that his
book could not be published until many years after his death. Sallust
was his model. The first edition appeared in 1610, and the second
more complete edition at Valencia in 1776. It is one of the finest
pieces of prose-writing in the Spanish language.</p>
<p>In his last years Don Diego found much pleasant employment in his
library. <span class="sidenote">Last days.</span> He corresponded
with Zurita, the historian of Aragon, telling him how the work of
looking over his books reminded him of many long-forgotten things, and
supplied him with much food for thought. While in Italy he had been
diligent in obtaining Greek MSS., and in other respects his library
was quite unique. He bequeathed it to Philip II., and it is now in the
Escurial.</p>

<h3>THE BOOK, “LAZARILLO DE TORMES”</h3>
</div>
<p class="ti0"><span class="smcap">Ticknor</span><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_3" id="FNanchor_3">[3]</a> describes <i>Lazarillo de
Tormes</i> as “a work of genius unlike anything that had preceded it.
<span class="sidenote">Ticknor’s opinion<br/>of the work.</span> Its object
is to give a pungent satire on all classes of society. It is written in
a very bold, rich, and idiomatic Castilian style. Some of its sketches
are among the most fresh and spirited that can be found in the whole
range of prose works of fiction. Those of the friar and the seller of
Indulgences were put under the ban of the Church.” They were expurgated
by the Inquisition in 1573, when an expurgated edition was published at
Madrid, and in the <i>Index Expurgatorius</i> of 1667.</p>
<p>The first edition in Spain was published at Burgos in 1554.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_4" id="FNanchor_4">[4]</a> It is
excessively rare. <span class="sidenote">First edition.</span> There
is a copy at Chatsworth, but none in the British Museum. The Duke
of Devonshire allowed the late Mr. H. Butler<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxviii">[p. xxviii]</span> Clarke to transcribe his copy of
the first edition. This was done with great care, exactly as it was
printed. In 1897 Mr. Butler Clarke printed 250 copies at Oxford, with a
facsimile of the old title-page.</p>
<p>Many other editions followed the first of 1554.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_5" id="FNanchor_5">[5]</a> In Mr. Grenville’s
library there is an Antwerp edition (12mo) of 1555, <span class="sidenote">Value of copies.</span> for which he paid seven
guineas. Colonel Stanley’s copy fetched £31:10s.; Mr. Hanroth’s,
£20:10s. The Paris editor of 1827 could only find a 1595 edition.</p>
<p>A second part, by some wretched scribbler, soon appeared, without
any merit. It makes Lazarillo go to sea in the Algiers expedition of
1541. The ship founders, he sinks to the bottom, crawls into a cave,
and is turned into a tunny fish. <span class="sidenote">Spurious<br/>second
parts.</span> He is then caught in a seine, returns by an effort of
will to the human form, and finally goes to live at Salamanca. There
was another second part by Juan de Luna, a teacher of Spanish at
Paris. It continues the story by making Lazaro serve several other
masters, and then become a religious recluse. Both second parts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxix">[p. xxix]</span> are miserable rubbish,
and ought never to be reprinted.</p>
<p>Yet they are included in recent Spanish editions, which is much
to be deplored. For the work itself is a classic. In at least two
instances the Dictionary of the Spanish Academy refers to <i>Lazarillo de
Tormes</i> as an authority for the meaning of words.</p>
<p class="centra mt2"><span class="smcap">English Translations</span></p>
<p class="mt1"><i>Lazarillo de Tormes</i> was first translated into
English by David Rowlands of Anglesey. He called it <i>The Pleasant
History of Lazarillo de Tormes drawn out of Spanish</i>. It was
published by Abel Jeffes in the Fore Street without Grepell-gate
near Groube Street at the sign of the Bell, and dedicated to Sir
Thomas Gresham. It contains the Prologue, and a short chapter at the
end about Lazaro’s continued prosperity, which is not in the first
edition of 1554. This is the best translation. It was published in
1586.</p>
<p>A new edition appeared in 1596, also published by Abel Jeffes, who
had then removed to the Blacke Fryers near Puddle Wharfe. There were
twenty editions or reprints, and <i>Lazarillo</i> was exceedingly popular
with the Elizabethan reading public.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxx">[p. xxx]</span></p>
<p>James Blakiston brought out a new edition in 1653 dedicated to Lord
Chandos. It consists of the translation by David Rowlands, omitting the
Prologue, and of a translation of the spurious second part by Juan de
Luna. Another edition appeared in 1669, another in 1677. The title is
<i>The Excellent History of Lazarillo de Tormes, the witty Spaniard</i>.</p>
<p>In 1726 there appeared <i>The Life and Adventures of Lazarillo de
Tormes, with twenty curious copper cuts</i>. In 1727 the nineteenth
edition was published. This version is a bad translation, omits the
Prologue, and includes the spurious second parts.</p>
<p>The worst performance of all was the edition of 1789 in two
volumes. The type is better, but it is a very careless reprint of a
bad translation. It omits the execrable illustrations of the earlier
editions. Spanish names are scarcely recognisable. Gelves is called
“the battle of Geleas!” for Escalona we have “Evealona.”</p>
<p>All these translations are from late editions; none from the first
edition.</p>

<h3>NOTES ON THE CHARACTER OF LAZARO</h3>
</div>
<p class="ti0"><span class="smcap">The conception</span> of the
author, Don Diego Hurtado de Mendoza, was first to portray a boy, with
everything against him, rising from the lowest rank of society to a
prosperous condition, and to give a humorous account of his adventures;
and secondly, to satirise certain types of men, the products of the age
in which he wrote, through the medium of his boy hero.</p>
<p>The author himself was a boy at the time, or at least a very young
man, a student at Salamanca. He had no model, and the conception
was quite original. He makes Lazarillo de Tormes a boy of his own
age. <span class="sidenote">The author made<br/>Lazaro’s age<br/>coincide
with<br/>his own.</span> Don Diego was born in 1503. Assuming Lazarillo
to have been born in 1503,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_6" id="FNanchor_6">[6]</a> he was about 10 years old when he took
service with the blind man, three years<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxii">[p. xxxii]</span> with his first three masters, and
14 years old when he took service with the seller of Indulgences. He
carried on the business of water-carrier from the ages of 15 to 19, and
was 20 when he married. That would bring him to 1523. The next year,
when the Cortes met at Toledo, is made to be the year when Lazarillo de
Tormes wrote the story of his life. Doubtless it was the year when Don
Diego really completed his little romance, also aged 21.</p>
<p>In conceiving the character of Lazaro it is likely that the young
student had in his mind what he himself might have been, if he had
been born in the same obscurity. <span class="sidenote">The author’s<br/>
conception of<br/>the two destinies.</span> “The two destinies”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_7" id="FNanchor_7">[7]</a> were framed
out of a noble and an ignoble birth, success in the latter case being
far more meritorious than in the former. We find this reflection in
the last sentence of the Prologue, where Don Diego points out how much
more those have done who, not being favoured by noble birth, have,
nevertheless, by cleverness and force of character, arrived at a good
estate. If this idea of a boy such as the author, but without his noble
birth and other advantages, was in Don Diego’s mind, we should expect
to find Lazaro portrayed as a boy of a naturally good disposition and
fine instincts, whose bad<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxiii">[p.
xxxiii]</span> qualities were due to his lowly birth and vicious
surroundings. It is just such a boy as this that Don Diego presents to
us.</p>
<p>Nothing could be worse than poor Lazaro’s home. His mother
was a widow who had intimacies with a groom of Moorish blood,
had a child by him, and lived on the proceeds of his thieving,
while Lazaro was employed to dispose of the stolen goods. <span class="sidenote">Lazaro’s baneful<br/>surroundings as a<br/>child.
His mother<br/>not unfeeling.</span> When they were found out, the
widow’s position became most precarious. Just then the wonderfully
clever and plausible blind man appeared on the scene. He offered
what, in comparison with the boy’s lot with his mother, seemed to
be a decent provision. She is accused of unfeeling conduct in thus
parting with her son. I do not think this is intended. The poor woman
did what she thought was best for the child, and their parting was
sorrowful and affectionate. Don Diego made her a thief and worse, but
not a mother without feeling.</p>
<p>The account of the professional cleverness and knowledge of the
blind man is very interesting, but, in spite of it all, the little
boy seems to have held his own to some extent with the old rascal.
<span class="sidenote">Capital stories<br/>most amusingly<br/>told.</span> The trick with the half blancas, the story of
the wine, and of the bunch of grapes, are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxiv">[p. xxxiv]</span> capitally told and very amusing.
It is true that the old man was handicapped by his blindness, though
his strength, cleverness, and experience made up for it. He treated
Lazaro abominably, but it must be acknowledged that, great as the
provocation was, the boy’s revenge was cruel and unfeeling. He was
sorry afterwards, for he wrote that his understanding was blinded in
that hour.</p>
<p>The boy’s ingenious ways of getting at the provisions of his second
master, who was starving him, are capitally and most amusingly told.
But the funniest and most witty story in the book is the boy’s terror
at the coffin he believed to be coming to the house, and the reason he
thought so.</p>
<p>With the first two masters it was an incessant fight against
starvation. Lazaro’s resourceful ingenuity was conspicuous, and, under
the circumstances, he had a perfect right to use all his wits against
the wretches who ill-treated him. But there was no opportunity of
bringing out his finer qualities.</p>
<p>With the third master it was very different. He was a penniless
esquire, starving himself, and so excessively proud that he thought
only of concealing his poverty. Lazaro had to resort to begging,
and so he kept his poor master, as well as himself, alive.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxv">[p. xxxv]</span> Here Lazaro comes
out in an excellent light. He <span class="sidenote">Lazaro’s
higher<br/> qualities shown<br/>in his intercourse<br/>with the
esquire.</span>was not only kind-hearted and generous, but he showed
tact and a wish to avoid hurting the poor proud creature’s feelings.
Don Diego thus shows his hero in the light of one of nature’s
gentlemen. The esquire’s account of himself, and his views of honour
and its obligations are interesting, as showing a type of character
which was common in Spain in those days. It was more elaborately
portrayed by Cervantes.</p>
<p>Lazaro is made to tell the story of the seller of Indulgences,
and a very amusing story it is, no doubt true to life. For it
aroused the anger of the Inquisition, and was expurgated from future
editions. But Lazaro merely appears as a narrator; and his character
is not developed; though it is in the rapid sketch of his rise to
prosperity. <span class="sidenote">Development<br/>of Lazaro’s<br/>character.</span> He was a lad who was liked. His girl-friends who
were kind to him in adversity, as well as the archpriest and many
others who were good friends when he rose to prosperity, showed that
he was a favourite among those with whom he came in contact.</p>
<p>His marriage brought him great advantages. Critics have called it
disgraceful, because we are told that evil tongues suggested that
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxvi">[p. xxxvi]</span> girl had
been the archpriest’s mistress. But there is nothing in the narrative
to justify the belief that the evil tongues did not lie. On the
contrary, the conclusion is the other way, and the story ends with a
defence of his wife by Lazaro himself.</p>
<p>The work is the production of a genius. <span class="sidenote">Merits<br/>of the work.</span> Its originality, and the
admirable way in which the stories in it are told make it deserving
of a wider audience, though of course it is well known to students of
the literature of Europe. Seldom has so much wit, fun, and wisdom been
gathered into so small a compass.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">PROLOGUE</h2>
</div>
<p class="ti0"><span class="smcap">I hold</span> it to be good that
such remarkable things as have happened to me, perhaps never before
seen or heard of, should not be buried in the tomb of oblivion.
<span class="sidenote">Reasons for<br/>relating all the<br/>circumstances<br/>of his life.</span> It may be that some one who
reads may find something that pleases him. For those who do not go
very deep into the matter there is a saying of Pliny “<i>that there is
no book so bad that it does not contain something that is good</i>.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_8" id="FNanchor_8">[8]</a> Moreover,
all tastes are not the same, and what one does not eat another will.
Thus we see things that are thought much of by some, depreciated by
others. Hence no circumstance ought to be omitted, how insignificant
soever it may be, but all should be made known, especially as some
fruit might be plucked from such a tree.</p>
<p>If this were not so, very few would write<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[p. 2]</span> at all, for it cannot be done without hard
work.</p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Motives of authors<br/>not to gain
money,<br/>but to win fame.</span>Authors do not wish to be
recompensed with money, but by seeing that their work is known
and read, and, if it contains anything that is worthy, that it is
praised. On this point Tully says: “Honour creates the arts.” Think
you that the soldier who is first on the ladder cares less for his
life than the others? Certainly not. It is the desire for fame that
leads him to seek such danger. It is the same in the arts and in
letters. We say: “The Doctor preaches very well and he is one who
desires much the welfare of souls,” but ask him whether he is much
offended when they say, “How wonderfully your reverence has done it!”
So also in arms, men report how such an one has jousted wretchedly,
and he has given his arms to a jester because he praised him for
using his lances so well. What would he have given if he had been
told the truth? Now that all things go in this manner, I confess that
I am not more righteous than my neighbours. I write in this rough
style, and all who may find any pleasure in it will be satisfied
to know that there lives a man who has met with such fortunes,
encountered such dangers, and suffered such adversities. I beseech
your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[p. 3]</span> Honour that you
will accept the poor service of one who would be richer if his power
was equal to his desire. Well, your Honour! This author writes what
he writes, and relates his story very fully.</p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Success<br/>of the poor<br/>should be a

begin in the middle, but quite at the beginning, so that there might
be a full notice of his personality, and also that those who inherit
noble estates may consider how little fortune owes them, having been
so very partial to them in its gifts; and how much more those have
done who, not being so favoured, have, by force and management,
arrived at a good estate.</p>

<p class="subh2">LAZARO RELATES THE WAY OF HIS BIRTH AND TELLS WHOSE SON HE IS</p>
</div>
<p class="ti0"><span class="smcap">Well!</span> your Honour must know,
before anything else, that they call me Lazarillo de Tormes, and that I
am the son of Thomé Gonçales and Antonia Perez, natives of Tejares,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_9" id="FNanchor_9">[9]</a> a village
near Salamanca. My birth was in the river Tormes,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_10" id="FNanchor_10">[10]</a> for which reason I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[p. 5]</span> have the river for a surname,
and it was in this manner.</p>
<p>My father, whom God pardon, had charge of a flour mill which was
on the banks of that river. He was the miller there for over fifteen
years, and my mother, being one night taken with me in the mill, she
gave birth to me there. So that I may say with truth that I was born in
the river.</p>
<p>When I was a child of eight years old, they accused my father of
certain misdeeds done to the sacks of those who came to have their
corn ground. He was taken into custody, and confessed and denied not,
suffering persecution for justice’s sake. So I trust in God that
he is in glory, for the Evangelist tells us that such are blessed.
At that time there was a certain expedition against the Moors<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_11" id="FNanchor_11">[11]</a> and
among the adventurers was my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[p.
6]</span> father, who was banished for the affair already mentioned. He
went in the position of attendant on a knight who also went, and, with
his master, like a loyal servant, he ended his life.</p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Death of Lazaro’s<br/>father, and his<br/>mother goes<br/>into service.</span>My widowed mother, finding
herself without husband or home, determined to betake herself to
the good things so as to be among them; so she went to live in the
city. She hired a small house, and was employed to prepare victuals
for certain students. She also washed the clothes of the stable-boys
who had charge of the horses of the Comendador de la Magdalena.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_12" id="FNanchor_12">[12]</a> Thus
she frequented the stables, she and a dark-coloured man, who was
one of those who had the care of the horses. They came to know each
other. <span class="sidenote">Flitting.</span>Sometimes he came to
our house late, and went away in the morning. At other times he came
to the door in the day-time, with the excuse that he wanted to buy
eggs, and walked into the house. At first I did not like him, for I
was afraid of his colour and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[p.
7]</span> his ugly face. But when I saw that his coming was the sign
of better living, I began to like him, for he always brought pieces
of meat, bread, and in the winter, fuel to warm us.</p>
<p><span class="sidenote">A swarthy<br/>stepfather and<br/>a little
brown<br/> brother.</span>This intercourse went on until one day
my mother gave me a pretty little brown brother, whom I played with
and helped to keep warm. I remember once that when my stepfather
was fondling the child, it noticed that my mother and I were white,
and that he was not. It frightened the child, who ran to my mother,
pointing with its finger and saying, “Mother, he is ugly!” To this he
replied laughing; but I noticed the words of my little brother, and,
though so young, I said to myself, “How many there are in the world
who run from others because they do not see themselves in them.”</p>
<p>It was our fate that the intimacy of the Zayde, for so they
called my stepfather, came to the ears of the steward. <span class="sidenote">The punishment<br/>for receiving<br/>and living
on<br/>stolen goods.</span>On looking into the matter he found that
half the corn he gave out for the horses was stolen, also that the
fuel, aprons, pillions, horse-cloths, and blankets were missing, and
that when nothing else was left, the horse-shoes were taken. With
all this my mother was helped to bring up the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[p. 8]</span> child. We need not wonder at a priest or
a friar, when one robs the poor, and the other his female devotees
to help a friend such as himself, when the love of a poor stable-lad
brings him to this.</p>
<p>All I have related was proved, because they cross-questioned me
with threats, and being a child I answered and let out all I knew from
fear, <span class="sidenote">Stolen<br/>horse-shoes.</span>down to certain
horse-shoes which, by my mother’s order, I sold to a blacksmith. They
flogged my unhappy stepfather, and put my mother on the accustomed
penance as a punishment. An order was given that she was not to enter
the stables of the Comendador, nor to receive the flogged Zayde in her
house.</p>
<p>The poor woman complied with the sentence that she might not lose
all; and to avoid danger and silence evil tongues she went away into
service. <span class="sidenote">Lazaro helps<br/>at the inn.Takes<br/>service
with<br/>a blind man.</span>She was employed in the open gallery of an inn,
and so she contrived to rear the little brother, though suffering from
many difficulties. She raised him until he could walk, and me until I
was a fine little boy, who went for wine and lights for the guests, and
for anything else they wanted.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">FIRST MASTER</h2>
<p class="subh2">HOW LAZARO TOOK SERVICE WITH A BLIND MAN</p>
</div>
<p class="ti0"><span class="smcap">At that time</span> a blind
man came to lodge at the inn, who, seeing that I would do to lead
him, asked for me from my mother. <span class="sidenote">Lazaro
enters<br/>the service<br/>of a blind man.</span>She gave me
to him, saying that I was the son of a good father, and boasting
that he had been killed at the Island of Gelves.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_13" id="FNanchor_13">[13]</a> She told the blind man
that she trusted in God that I would not turn out a worse man than my
father, and she begged him to treat me well and look after me, as I
was an orphan. He answered that he would do so, and that he received
me not as his servant but as his son. Thus it was that I began to
serve and to lead my new master. We were in Salamanca for some days,
but, as the earnings were not to my master’s liking, he determined
to go somewhere else. <span class="sidenote">Lazaro’s farewell<br/>to
his mother.</span>When we were about to depart, I went to see my
mother, and, both weeping, she gave me her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[p. 12]</span> blessing and said, “I shall see you no
more. Strive to be good, and may God direct your ways. You have been
brought up, and are now put with a good master. Farewell!” And so I
went away to my master who was waiting for me.</p>
<p><span class="sidenote">A cruel trick<br/>of the wicked<br/>old blind
man.</span>We went out of Salamanca and came to the bridge. There
is, at the entrance of it, an animal of stone<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_14" id="FNanchor_14">[14]</a> which almost has the
shape of a bull. The blind man told me to go near this animal, and,
being there, he said, “Lazaro, put your ear against this bull, and
you will hear a great noise inside.” I did so, like a simpleton,
believing it to be as he said. When he felt that my head was against
the stone, he raised his hand and gave me a tremendous blow against
the devil of a bull, so that I felt the pain for more than three days.
<span class="sidenote">Lazaro and<br/>the blind man.</span>Then he said
to me, “This will teach you that a blind man’s boy ought to be one
point more knowing than the devil himself”; and he laughed heartily at
his joke. It seemed to me that, in an instant, I awoke from <span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[p. 15]</span>my simplicity in which I had
reposed from childhood. I said to myself, “This man says truly that it
behoves me to keep my eyes open, for I am alone and have to think for
myself.”</p>

    “<i>He answered that he received me, not as his servant but as his son.</i>”
  </p>
</div>
<p class="mt1">We set out on our road, and in a very few days
I showed myself to be sprightly, which pleased the blind man,
and he said, “I can give you neither gold nor silver, but I
can teach you much in the ways of getting a livelihood.” <span class="sidenote">Wonderful<br/>sagacity and<br/>cleverness of
the<br/>blind man.</span>It was so that, after a few days, he showed
me many things, and being blind himself, he enlightened and guided me
in the ways of life. I mention these trifles to your Honour to show
how much knowledge men must have when they are down, and to keep from
falling when they are exalted.</p>
<p>Speaking of the good there was in my blind man, your Honour must
know that since God created the world He has not made a being more
astute and sagacious. In his own line he was unequalled. He knew a
hundred or more prayers of the choir, he recited in a low and very
tuneful voice, he put on a devout and very humble countenance when he
recited, without making faces or gestures as others usually do. Besides
this he had a hundred other ways and means of getting money. He knew
how to make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[p. 16]</span> prayers
on different occasions, for women who were childless, for those who
were about to bear children, and for those who had married unhappily,
that their husbands might like them well. He foretold whether a
woman would have a boy or a girl. In the matter of medicine he said
that Galen did not possess half his knowledge for curing toothaches,
fainting fits, or illnesses of mothers. Finally, no one mentioned what
pain or illness he or she was suffering from, but he told them at
once—do this, you should do that, gather such a herb, take such a root.
In this way he went with all the world after him, especially the women.
They believed whatever he said, and from them he drew great profits by
the arts I have described, for he gained more in a month than a hundred
other blind men would in a year. I also desire that your Honour should
know that, in spite of all he acquired and had, I never met a man so
avaricious and stingy, insomuch that he nearly killed me with hunger,
depriving me of the necessaries of life.</p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The blind man’s<br/>way of making<br/>money and<br/>his avarice.</span>I tell the truth, that if, by
way of subtlety and cunning, I had not found a remedy, I should
many times have succumbed to starvation. With all his knowledge and
experience, I managed so well that, oftener than not, I got the best
of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[p. 17]</span> it. On account
of these matters, there were infernal rows between us, of which I
will relate some but not all.</p>
<p>He carried the bread, and all the rest of his things, in a linen
knapsack, closing the mouth with an iron chain having a padlock and
key. He put in and took out his things himself, using great vigilance,
and he kept such a close account that there was not a man in all the
world who could have taken so much as a crumb without his knowing
it. <span class="sidenote">Lazaro finds his<br/>way into the blind<br/>man’s
knapsack.</span>Well, I had to take the lazar’s allowance which he gave
me. It was all despatched in less than two mouthfuls. After he had
locked the bag and was not looking out, thinking that I was attending
to other things, by a little unstitching I often opened one side of
the bag and sewed it up again; bleeding the avaricious knapsack not
only of bread but of good pieces of bacon and sausage. Thus I watched
for convenient times to make up for the infernal wrong that the wicked
blind man inflicted on me.</p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Lazaro’s adroit<br/>contrivance with<br/>the half
“blancas.”</span>All that I could pilfer and steal I carried in half
“blancas.” When they paid him for saying prayers for them, they gave
him a whole “blanca.” But as he could not see, I had got it in my
mouth, and put a half blanca in its place,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[p. 18]</span> before his hand had reached it, quick as
he was, so that he only got half-price. The evil-minded blind man
complained when he found that it was not a whole “blanca.” He said to
me: “How the devil is it that since you have been with me they only
give half ‘blancas,’ and before it used to be a whole ‘blanca’ or even
a ‘maravedi’ that they gave me?<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_15" id="FNanchor_15">[15]</a> The ill-luck has come with you.” So he
shortened up the prayers and did not give them more than half, ordering
me to remind him to stop by pulling his sleeve. Then he began to cry
out that they had called for such and such a prayer from him, such as
he used to recite, and that he had given it.</p>
<p>The blind man used to have a small jug of wine near him when he
dined; and quick as thought I gave it silent kisses when I put it
down for him. But it was not long before he noticed the loss in what
he drank, so he never let the jug out of his hand, but always kept
it by him. <span class="sidenote">Various ways<br/>of getting<br/>at the
wine.</span>However,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[p. 19]</span>
he had no magnet to point to what went on, while I had a long oaten
straw which I prepared for this need of mine. Slipping it into the
mouth of the jug I sucked up the wine to my heart’s content. The old
rascal, being very astute, suspected something. So he put the jug
between his knees and, covering the mouth with his hand, drank in
security. Seeing the wine go I craved for it. The straw being no longer
of any avail, I hit upon another plan. I succeeded in making a tiny
hole in the bottom of the jug, and stopped it with a small piece of
wax. When dinner-time came I pretended to be cold, and got between
the old man’s legs, to warm myself at the poor little light we had.
With the same light I melted the wax, and very soon a little fountain
began to drain into my mouth, which I placed so that I should not lose
a drop. When the poor old man wanted to drink he got nothing. His
astonishment was expressed in curses, devoting the wine and the jug to
the devil. “You cannot think that I have been drinking, uncle!” I said,
“for you have not let the jug out of your hand.” But he gave the jug so
many twists and turns that at last he found the hole. He said nothing.
<span class="sidenote">The wicked<br/>blind man’s<br/>cruel revenge.</span>Next
day I was sucking at my hole as usual, thinking no evil,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[p. 20]</span> and little dreaming of
what he was getting ready for me. I was seated on the ground, taking
in those delicious draughts, my face turned up to heaven, my eyes half
closed the better to enjoy the toothsome liquor, when the wicked blind
man took his revenge. He raised the jug with both hands, and, with all
his might, sent it crashing down on my mouth. Poor Lazaro was quite off
his guard, being careless and joyous as at other times. Truly it seemed
to me as if the sky and all that was in it had fallen upon me. The blow
was so great that the pieces of the jug cut my face in several parts
and broke my teeth, so that I remain without them to this day.</p>
<p><span class="sidenote">A coolness<br/>arises between<br/>Lazaro and<br/>the
blind man.</span>From that time I wished evil to the cruel blind man,
and, although he was kind to me afterwards and cured me, I saw very
well that he enjoyed my cruel punishment. He washed the bruises and
places torn by the bits of the broken jug, but he smiled as he did so,
saying, “What would you have, Lazaro? If I wish you ill I cure you and
restore you to health,” with other jokes which were not to my taste,
when I had only half recovered from my wounds. I now wanted to free
myself from him, thinking that a few more such blows might free him
from me. He was not much inclined to see to my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[p. 21]</span> health and welfare, and even if I had
wished to forgive him the blow with the jug, his evil treatment of me
from that time would have prevented it.</p>
<p>Without cause or reason, the malignant blind man was always beating
me and knocking me about. If any one asked him why he treated me so
badly, he told the story of the jug, adding: “Think you that my boy is
a little innocent? Well, listen and judge whether the devil himself
could have played such tricks. Who could believe that such a small boy
could be so depraved.” Then they said: “Chastise him in God’s name,”
and he never did anything else.</p>
<p>So I led him by the worst ways, seeking to do him harm, taking
him over stony places and into mud. <span class="sidenote">Lazaro
is beaten,<br/>so the blind<br/>man is led<br/>into the mud.</span>He always
beat me on the back of my head, so that it was covered with bruises,
and although I cried out that I did not do it on purpose, but only
because there was no better road, he did not believe me, such was the
astuteness and intelligence of the old ruffian.</p>
<p>In order that your Honour may judge of the cleverness of this
knowing old man I will relate one thing out of many that happened while
I was with him. When we left<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[p.
22]</span> Salamanca his intention was to go to Toledo, for he said
that the people there were richer, though not very charitable. He
repeated this saying, “The hard man gives more than the penniless man.”
We took the road by the best places, where we were well received. It
happened that we came to a place called Almorox<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_16" id="FNanchor_16">[16]</a> at the time of the
vintage. A grape-gatherer gave us a bunch out of charity. As the
baskets are knocked about, and the grapes at that time are very hard,
the blind man kept the bunch in his hand and, to content me, he
determined to have a banquet with it, instead of putting it in his bag.
For on that day he had given me many blows and kicks.</p>
<p>We sat down in an enclosed place and he said: “Now I am going to
treat you with liberality. <span class="sidenote">The way Lazaro<br/>and
the blind<br/>man shared<br/>a bunch of grapes.</span>We will both eat this
bunch of grapes in equal shares, and it shall be in this way. You take
one and I will take another. You must only take one at a time, and I
will take another until it is finished. In this way there can be no
trick.” So we began. At the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[p.
23]</span> second turn the old traitor began to take two at a time.
As he had broken the agreement I thought that I ought to do the
same. Not content to do as he did, I began to take three at a time.
When the bunch was finished, he sat for some time with the stalk
in his hand. <span class="sidenote">An example<br/>of the blind man’s<br/>
cleverness.</span>Then he said, “Lazaro, you have deceived me. I would
swear to God that you have been eating three at a time.” “I did not
eat so,” I declared. “Why do you suspect me?” “Would you know how I am
certain that you took three at a time?” he replied. “It is because when
I began to take two at a time you said nothing.”</p>
<p>Though only a boy I noted the cleverness of the old man. But
to avoid being dull I will leave out many things both curious and
remarkable that happened to me while I was with my first master, for
I wish to come to the leave-taking, and with that there is an end of
him.</p>
<p>We were at Escalona,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_17" id="FNanchor_17">[17]</a> a town belonging<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[p. 24]</span> to the Duke of that name, lodging at an
inn.</p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Lazaro falls into<br/>temptation and<br/>eats the
sausage.</span>The blind man gave me a piece of sausage to roast.
When the sausage had been basted and the toasted bread on which the
grease was poured had been eaten, he took a maravedi out of his bag
and sent me to fetch wine from a tavern. The devil put the temptation
before my eyes, which, as they say, is how a thief is made. There was
also a long piece of colewort<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_18" id="FNanchor_18">[18]</a> on the fire, which, being unfit for the
pot, ought to have been thrown away. There was nobody but the blind
man and myself, and I became very greedy under the delicious smell of
the sausage. I only thought of present enjoyment, without considering
what might happen afterwards. As the blind man took the money out of
his bag, I took the sausage,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[p.
25]</span> and quickly put the colewort to be cooked in its place. When
my master handed the money to me I took it, and went for the wine, not
failing to eat the sausage.</p>
<p>When the sinful blind man found the colewort in the pot, of which he
knew nothing, he thought it was the sausage and bit it. Then he said,
“What is this, Lazaro?” I said “Had I not gone for the wine? Some one
else has been here and has done it for fun.” “No! No!” he cried, “that
is impossible, for I have never let the pan out of my hand.” I then
turned to swear, and swore again, that it was not me. But it availed
me nothing. From the cunning of the cursed blind man nothing could be
hidden.</p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Dreadful trouble<br/>about the sausage.</span>My
master got up and took me by the head. Presently he began to smell me,
and forcing my mouth open, he put his nose in. It was a long pointed
nose. What with the turn I had, the choke in my throat, and the fright
I was in, the sausage would not stay on my stomach, and the whole thing
came back to its owner. The evil blind man so worked my inside that
the half-masticated sausage and the long nose came out of my mouth
together. O Lord! who would not rather have been buried than go through
that misery? The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[p. 26]</span> rage
of the perverse old man was such that if people had not been drawn
there by the noise, he would not have left me alive. They took me from
him, leaving his few hairs in my hands, and his face and throat all
scratched, which he deserved for his cruel treatment of me.</p>
<p>The blind man related all my misfortunes over and over again,
including the story of the jug and of the bunch of grapes. The laughter
was so loud that all the passers-by came in to see the fun; for the
old wretch told the stories of my misfortunes so well that even I,
ill-treated as I was, could not help half joining in the laughter.
<span class="sidenote">Lazaro recovers<br/>from the effects<br/>of the
sausage.</span>Remembering my troubles there came a weakness upon me.
But my stomach recovered, and the landlady of the inn, with others who
were present, washed my face and throat with the wine that had been
brought to drink. This enraged the wicked blind man, who declared that
I would cost him more wine with my washings in one year, than he could
drink in two.</p>
<p>“Lazaro,” he said, “you owe more to the wine than to your father.
He got you once, but the wine has brought you to life several times.”
Then he counted how many times he had torn and bruised my face and
afterwards cured it with wine.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[p.
27]</span> “If there is a man in the world who ought to be lucky with
wine,” he added, “it is you.”</p>
<p>Those who were washing me laughed a good deal at what the old man
said, though I dissented. However, the prognostications of the blind
rascal did not turn out false, and afterwards I often thought of that
man, who certainly had the spirit of prophecy.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_19" id="FNanchor_19">[19]</a> The evil things he did to
me made me sad, though I paid him back, as your Honour will presently
hear.</p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Lazaro<br/>determined<br/>to leave<br/>the blind
man.</span>Seeing all this, and how the blind man made me a
laughing-stock, I determined that at all hazards I would leave him.
This resolution was always in my mind, and the last game he played
confirmed it. On another day we left the town to seek alms. It had
rained a great deal in the previous night. It continued to rain in the
day-time, and we got under some arcades in that town, so as to keep out
of the wet. Night was coming on and the rain did not cease. The blind
man said to me, “Lazaro! this rain is very persistent, and as the night
closes in it will not cease, so we will make for the inn in good time.
To go there we have to cross a stream which will have become swollen
by the heavy rain.” I replied,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[p.
28]</span> “Uncle! the stream is now very broad, but if you like I can
take you to a place where we can get across without being wet, for it
becomes much narrower, and by jumping we can clear it.” This seemed
good advice, so he said, “You are discreet and you shall take me to
that place where the stream becomes so narrow, for it is winter time,
and a bad thing to get our feet wet.” <span class="sidenote">Lazaro
prepares<br/>to revenge himself<br/>on the blind man.</span>Seeing that things
were going as I wished, I took him out of the arcade, and placed him
just in front of a stone pillar that stood in the square. Then I said
to him, “Uncle, this is the narrowest part of the stream.”</p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Lazaro’s<br/>cruel vengeance<br/>on the blind
man.</span>As the rain continued and he was getting wet, we were in
a hurry to get shelter from the water that was falling upon us. The
principal thing was (seeing that God blinded my understanding in that
hour) to be avenged. The old man believed in me and said, “Put me in
the right place while you jump over the stream.” So I put him just in
front of the pillar, and placed myself behind it. I then said, “Jump
with all your might so as to clear the stream.” I had hardly finished
speaking, when the poor old man, balancing himself like a goat, gave
one step backwards, and then sprang with all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[p. 29]</span> his force. His head came with such a
noise against the pillar that it sounded like a great calabash. He
fell down half dead. “How was it you could smell the sausage and not
the post? Oh! Oh!” I shouted. <span class="sidenote">Lazaro leaves<br/>
his first master.</span>I left him among several people who ran to
help him, while I made for the gate of the town at a sharp trot,
so that before nightfall I might be in Torrijos, not knowing nor
caring what afterwards happened to my blind man.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_20" id="FNanchor_20">[20]</a></p>

<h2 class="nobreak">SECOND MASTER</h2>
<p class="subh2">HOW LAZARO TOOK SERVICE WITH A CLERGYMAN, AND OF THE
    THINGS THAT HAPPENED TO HIM.</p>
</div>
<p class="ti0"><span class="smcap">Next day</span>, <span class="sidenote">The clergyman’s<br/>chest.</span> as I did not feel
that I should be quite safe at Torrijos,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_21" id="FNanchor_21">[21]</a> I stopped at a
place called Maqueda,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_22" id="FNanchor_22">[22]</a> where for my sins I took service with
a clergyman. Going to him to ask for alms, he inquired<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[p. 31]</span> whether I knew how to
assist at Mass. I said yes, which was true, for though the blind
man ill-treated me, he taught me many useful things, and one of
them was this. Finally the clergyman took me as his servant. <span class="sidenote">Out of<br/>the frying-pan<br/>into the fire.</span>I had
escaped from the thunder to fall under the lightning. For compared
with this priest, the blind man was an Alexander the Great. I will say
no more than that all the avarice in the world was combined in this
man, but I know not whether it was naturally born in him or whether it
was put on with the priestly habit. He had an old chest closed with
a key which he carried with him, fastened to the belt of his gown.
When he brought the “bodigos”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_23" id="FNanchor_23">[23]</a> from the church, they were quickly locked up
in the chest, and there was nothing to eat in the house such as is to
be seen in other houses, a piece of bacon, some bits of cheese on a
shelf or in a cupboard, or a few pieces of bread that may have remained
over from the table. It seemed to me that the sight of such things,
even if I could not have them, would have been a consolation.</p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Nothing in the<br/>clergyman’s house<br/>but an old chest,<br/>and a string<br/>of onions.</span>There
was only a string of onions, and these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[p. 32]</span> were under lock and key in an upper
chamber, one being allowed for every four days. If I asked for the
key, to fetch the allowance, and any one else was present, he put his
hand in his pocket, and gave it to me with great ceremony, telling
me to take it and return at once without taking anything else; as if
all the conserves of Valencia were there. Yet there was not a thing
in the room but the onions hanging from a nail, and he kept such a
strict account of them, that if I ever took more than my allowance it
cost me dear. At last I was near dead with hunger.</p>
<p>If he showed little charity to me, he treated himself as badly.
Small bits of meat formed his usual food for dinner and supper. It
is true that he shared the gravy with me, but nothing more except a
small piece of bread. On Saturdays they eat sheep’s head in those
parts, and my master sent me for one that was to cost three maravedis.
He cooked it and ate all the eyes, tongue, brains, and the meat off
the cheeks, giving me the well-picked bone on a plate, and saying,
“Take! Eat! Triumph! for you is the world, and you live better than
the Pope.” <span class="sidenote">Lazaro was<br/>sinking into<br/>the silent
tomb<br/>from hunger.</span>At the end of three weeks I became so weak
that I could scarcely stand on my feet for hunger. I saw myself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[p. 33]</span> sinking down into the
silent tomb. If God and my own intelligence had not enabled me to avail
myself of ingenious tricks, there would have been no remedy for me.</p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Extraordinary<br/>stinginess of<br/>the
clergyman.</span>When we were at the offertory not a single blanca was
dropped into the shell without being registered by him. He kept one eye
on the congregation and the other on my hands, moving his eyes about
as if they were quicksilver. He knew exactly how many blancas had been
given, and as soon as the offertory was over, he took the shell from
me and put it on the altar. During all the time I lived, or rather was
dying in his service, I never was master of a single blanca. I never
brought a blanca worth of wine from a tavern, but it was put into his
chest to last for a week. To conceal his extreme stinginess he said
to me, “Look here, boy! Priests have to be very frugal in eating and
drinking, and for this reason I do not feed like other people.” But
he lied shamefully. For at meetings and funerals where we had to say
prayers and responses, and where he could get food at the expense of
others, he ate like a wolf and drank more than a proposer of toasts.</p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Lazaro prayed<br/>for the deaths<br/>of sick
people,<br/>for the sake of<br/>the funeral feasts.</span>And why do I speak
of funerals? God<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[p. 34]</span>
forgive me! for I never was an enemy to the human race except on those
occasions. Then we could eat well, and I wished, and even prayed to
God that He would kill some one every day. When we gave the Sacraments
to the sick, especially extreme unction, the priest was called upon to
say prayers for those who were present. I was certainly not the last in
prayer, for with all my heart I besought the Lord that He would take
the sick man to Himself. If any one recovered I devoted him to the
devil a thousand times. He who died received many benedictions from me,
yet the number of persons who died during the whole time I was there,
which was over six months, only amounted to twenty. I verily believed
that I killed them, or rather that they died in answer to my prayers,
the Lord seeing how near death I was, and that their deaths gave me
life.</p>
<p>But there was no remedy, for if on the days of the funerals I lived,
on the days when no one died I was starving, and I felt it all the
more. So that there seemed to be no rest for me but in death; and I
often desired it for myself, as well as for others.</p>
<p>I frequently thought of leaving my penuri<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[p. 35]</span>ous master, but two things detained me. The
first was that I feared my legs would not carry me, so reduced was I by
starvation. The other was the consideration that I had had two masters.
The first starved me, the second brought me to death’s door, and a
third might finish me. It appeared that any change might be for the
worse.</p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Lazaro is saved<br/>from starvation<br/>by an angel <br/>of a locksmith.</span>One day when my wretched
master was out, a locksmith came to the door by chance. I thought
that he was an angel sent to me by the hand of God, in the dress
of a workman. He asked me whether I had any work for him to do.
Inspired by the Holy Spirit I replied: “Uncle! I have lost a key,
and I fear that my master will whip me. Kindly see if there are any
on your bunch that will fit the lock, and I will pay you for it.”
<span class="sidenote">The chest opened.</span> The angelic locksmith
began to try his keys, and soon the chest was opened, and I beheld
the Lord’s gift in the form of bread. “I have no money,” I said, “to
give you for the key, but take what you like in payment.” He took one
of the loaves that looked the best, and went away quite satisfied,
leaving the key with me. <span class="sidenote">Lazaro is happy<br/>until
the<br/>clergyman begins<br/>to smell a rat.</span>I did not touch anything,
at the moment, because I did not feel the need. My wretched master
came back, and, as God willed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[p.
36]</span> it, he did not look into the trunk which that angel
had opened. But next day, when he had gone out, I opened my bread
paradise and took a loaf between the hands and teeth. In two <i>credos</i>
I made it invisible. Not forgetting the open chest, I rejoiced to
think that, with this remedy, my life would be less miserable. Thus
I was happy with him for two days, but it was not destined that this
should continue. <span class="sidenote">The clergyman<br/>counts the
loaves<br/>of bread.</span>For on the third day, at the very time that
I was dying of hunger, he was to be seen at our chest, counting and
recounting the loaves. I dissimulated, and, in my secret prayers and
devotions, I implored that he might be blinded. After he had been
counting for a long time, he said: “If I did not keep such an exact
account I should think that some loaves have been taken from this
chest. From this day I shall have a more accurate account. There are
now nine loaves and part of another.” “New misfortunes have come,” I
said to myself, and I felt that my stomach would soon be in the same
wretched state as before.</p>
<p>When the priest went out, I opened the chest as some consolation,
and when I saw the bread I began to worship it, giving it a
thousand kisses. But I did not pass that day<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[p. 37]</span> so happily as the day before. As my hunger
increased, so did my longing for more bread. At length God, who helps
the afflicted, showed me a remedy. I said to myself: “This chest is
old, and broken in some parts, though the holes are very small. The
belief might be suggested that rats had got through these holes and had
eaten some of the bread.” It would not do to eat wholesale, but I began
to crumble the bread over some not very valuable cloth, taking some and
leaving some, and thus I got a meal. When the priest came to examine
the damage, he did not doubt that it had been done by the rats, because
it seemed to be done just in the way that rats would do it. He looked
over the chest from one end to the other, and saw the holes by which
the rats might have entered.</p>
<p>He then called to me and said: “Lazaro, look! Look what damage has
been done to our bread last night!” I appeared to be much astonished,
and wondered how it could have happened. <span class="sidenote">It
was the rats.</span>“It is the rats,” he declared, “they would leave
us nothing.” We went to our meal, and even there it pleased God that
I should come off well; for he gave me more than usual, including
all the parts he thought the rats had touched, saying: “Eat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[p. 38]</span> this which the rat has
cleaned.” Thus the work of my hands, or rather nails, was added to my
allowance.</p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The clergyman<br/>boards up<br/>all the rat holes<br/>
in the old chest.</span>Presently I beheld another piece of work. The
wretched priest was pulling nails out of the wall, and looking for
small boards with which to cover all the holes in the ancient chest.
“O Lord!” I then said to myself, “to what miseries and disasters are
we born, and how brief are our pleasures in this our toilsome life! I
thought that by this poor little contrivance I might find a way to pass
out of my misery, and I even ventured to rejoice at my good-fortune,
and now my ill-luck has returned.” Using all the diligence in his
power, for misers as a rule are not wanting in that commodity, he shut
the door of my consolation while he boarded up the holes in the chest.
Thus I made my lamentation, as an end was made to the work, with many
small boards and nails. “Now,” said the priest, “the traitor rats will
find little in this house, and had better leave us, for there is not a
hole left large enough for a mosquito to get in.”</p>

    “<i>‘It is the rats,’ he declared.</i>”
  </p>
</div>
<p class="mt1">When he was gone I opened the chest with my key without
any hope of profit from doing so. There were the three or four
loaves <span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[p. 41]</span>which my
master thought the rats had not begun upon. Night and day I thought
of some other plan, with the help of my hunger, for they say that it
is an aid to invention. It certainly was so with me. One night I was
deep in thought, meditating how I might use the contents of the chest
again. My master was snoring loudly, so I took an old knife and went to
the chest. I used the knife in the way of a gimlet, and as the ancient
piece of furniture was without strength or heart, it soon surrendered,
and allowed me to make a nice hole. This done I opened the chest, had a
good meal, and went back to my straw bed, where I rested and slept.</p>
<p>Next day my master saw both the hole and the damage done to his
provisions. He began to commend the rats to the devil, saying, “What
shall we say to this! Never have I known rats in this house until now.”
He may well have spoken the truth, for such creatures do not stay where
there is nothing to eat. <span class="sidenote">What the<br/>clergyman did<br/>
by day, Lazaro<br/>undid by night.</span> He turned to find more nails
in the wall, and a small board to cover the hole. Night came and he
retired to rest, while I set to work to open by night what he had
closed up in the day. It was like the weaving of Penelope, for all he
did by day I undid by night. In a few days we got<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[p. 42]</span> the poor old chest into such a state, that
it might be described as a sieve of old time rather than a chest.</p>
<p>When the miserly priest saw that his remedies were of no use he
said: “This chest is so knocked about, and the wood is so old and weak
that there is not a rat against which it can be defended. We will leave
it without defence outside, and I will go to the cost of three or four
reals. As the best outside guard is no use, I will attack these cursed
rats from the inside.” He presently borrowed a rat-trap, and begged
some pieces of cheese from the neighbours. This was a great help to me.
In truth I did not need much sauce for my bread, still, I enjoyed the
bits of cheese which I got from the rat-trap.</p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The rat-trap<br/>adds cheese<br/>to Lazaro’s
bread.</span>When he found the bread eaten in rat’s fashion, the
cheese gone, and no rats caught, he again commended the rats to the
devil. He asked the neighbours how the cheese could have been taken
without the rat being caught. They agreed that it could not have been
a rat. One neighbour remembered that there used to be a snake in the
house, and they all concurred that it must have been the snake. <span class="sidenote">It must have<br/>been a snake.</span>As it is long it
could have taken the cheese without being caught in the trap. This
exercised the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[p. 43]</span> mind
of my master very much, and from that time he slept so lightly that
the slightest sound made him think that the snake was going into the
chest. Then he would jump up and give the chest many violent blows with
a stick, intending to frighten the snake. The noise used to awaken the
neighbours, while I could not sleep. He rolled about my straw, and me
with it, because the neighbours said that snakes liked to keep warm
in the straw, or in cradles where there are babies, where they even
bit them and were dangerous. I generally went to sleep again, and he
told me about it in the morning, saying: “Did you feel nothing last
night, my boy? I was after the snake, and I even think it came to your
bed, for when snakes are cold they seek for warmth.” I replied, “It
was lucky it did not bite me, but I am terribly frightened.” I did not
get up or go to the chest at night, but waited until my master was in
church. He used to see the inroads on his bread, but knew not how to
apply a remedy.</p>
<p>I began to be afraid that, with all my diligence, he might find my
key which I kept amongst the straw. I thought it would be safer to put
it in my mouth. <span class="sidenote">Lazaro<br/>determined<br/>to keep the
key<br/>in his mouth—a<br/>fatal mistake.</span>For when I lived with the blind
man I used my mouth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[p. 44]</span>
as a purse, keeping ten or twelve maravedis in it, all in half blancas,
without being prevented from eating. Without that plan I could not have
kept a blanca from the knowledge of the cursed blind man, for I had
not a seam or a lining which he did not examine very minutely. So, as
I have said, I put the key in my mouth every night, and slept without
fear that my wizard of a master would find it. But when misfortune
comes, wit and diligence are of no avail.</p>
<p>It chanced, owing to ill-luck, or rather owing to my sins, that I
was sleeping one night with the key in my mouth in such a position that
the air went out of the hollow in the key and caused it to whistle so
that, for my sins, my master heard it. So he got up with the club in
his hand, and came to me very quietly that the snake might not hear,
for he felt no doubt that it was the snake. He thought that it was in
the straw, and he raised the club with the intention of giving it such
a blow as to kill it. So he hit me on the head with all his force and
left me senseless.</p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Lazaro<br/>is found out,<br/>and half
killed<br/>in the process.</span>Seeing the quantity of blood he
understood the harm he had done me, and went in a great hurry to get
a light. Coming back he found me with the key in my mouth, half of
it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[p. 45]</span> projecting, in
the same way as it was when I was whistling with it. The killer of
snakes was astounded that it should have been the key. He took it out
of my mouth to see what it was. Then he went to try it in the lock,
and found out my practices. He said that the rats and the snake that
devoured his substance were found. What happened in the next three
days I know not, for I was in the belly of the whale. At the end of
that time my senses returned. I found myself lying on my straw, and
my head covered with unguents and plasters. I was astounded and said:
“What is this?” The cruel priest answered that he had caught the
rats and the serpent. Finding myself so evilly treated, I began to
understand what had happened. At this time an old woman came in and
dressed my wound. Then the neighbours began to take off the bandages.
They rejoiced when they saw that I had recovered my senses, and began
to laugh over my misfortunes while I, as the sinner, mourned over
them. <span class="sidenote">Lazaro recovers<br/> and is shown<br/>the door.</span>With all this they gave me something to eat, so
that in a fortnight I could get up and was out of danger, though
suffering from hunger. On another day, when I was up, my master took
me by the hand and put me outside the door.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[p. 46]</span> Being in the street, he said: “From
to-day, Lazaro, you are your own master and not my servant. Seek
another master, and go, in God’s name; for I do not want such a
diligent person in my service, who is only fit to be a blind man’s
guide.” He then crossed himself as if he thought I had a devil, went
back into the house, and shut the door.</p>

<p class="subh2">HOW LAZARO TOOK SERVICE WITH A GENTLEMAN, AND WHAT
    HAPPENED TO HIM</p>
</div>
<p class="ti0"><span class="smcap">Thus</span> I was obliged to
seek strength out of weakness, and little by little, with the
help of kind people, I reached this famous city of Toledo. <span class="sidenote">Lazaro reaches<br/>Toledo, and seeks<br/>for a master.</span>
At the end of fifteen days, by the mercy of God, my wound was healed.
While I was ill people gave me some alms, but as soon as I was well
they all said, “You lazy little vagabond, go and seek for a master whom
you may serve.” “But where can I find one?” I said to myself.</p>
<p><span class="sidenote">On the road<br/>to Toledo.</span>I was
wandering about from door to door, without any settled purpose,
when I came upon an esquire,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_24" id="FNanchor_24">[24]</a> who was walking down the street, fairly well
dressed and groomed. He looked at me and I at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[p. 48]</span> him. <span class="sidenote">The
esquire.</span>He then said, “Boy! are you seeking for a master?” I
replied, “Yes, sir!” “Then come along behind me,” he said, “for God has
shown mercy to you by letting you meet with me.” So I followed him,
giving thanks to God. Judging from his dress and manner I thought he
was the sort of master of whom I stood in need.</p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Lazaro enters<br/>the service<br/>of an
esquire.</span>It was in the morning when I met with my third master,
and I followed him over a great part of the city. He passed by the
place where they sell bread and other provisions, and I thought and
desired that he would employ me to carry what he bought, for it was
the time for marketing. But, with a slow step, he passed by all these
things. Perhaps, I thought, he is not satisfied with them and intends
to make his purchases in some other place. In this way we walked about
until eleven in the forenoon, when he entered the principal church,
and I at his heels. I saw him hear Mass and the other divine offices
very devoutly until the service was all finished, and the people had
gone. Then we left the church and began to walk down the street. I was
the happiest boy in the world to see that my master had not troubled
himself about <span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[p. 51]</span>marketing,
for I deduced from that the belief that he had everything at home,
where I should find all that I desired. At last we came to a house
before which my master stopped, and I with him.</p>

    “<i>I followed him over a great part of the city.</i>”
  </p>
</div>
<p class="mt1"><span class="sidenote">The esquire<br/>takes Lazaro<br/>to his
house.</span>Throwing the end of his cloak over his left shoulder, he
took a key out of his sleeve and opened the door. We entered the house.
It was so dark and dismal that it might cause fear to any one coming
in. Within there was a small court and fair-sized rooms. He then took
off his cloak and, first asking whether I had clean hands, he shook it
and folded it. Then, after very carefully blowing the dust off a bench
that was there, he put the cloak on it. Having done this he sat upon it
and began to ask me questions, in great detail, as to where I came from
and how I reached the city. I had to give him a much longer account
than I cared for, as it seemed to me that it was a more convenient time
for laying the cloth and getting the meal ready than for answering
what he asked. Nevertheless, I satisfied his curiosity with the best
lies I could invent, relating all I had done well, and holding my
tongue about the rest, which did not appear to me to be appropriate.
<span class="sidenote">Nothing to eat<br/>in the esquire’s<br/>house.</span>This
done, we remained in the same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[p.
52]</span> place for a while. It was now nearly two o’clock in the
afternoon, and there was no more sign of anything to eat than there
would be for the dead.</p>
<p>After this my master closed the door and locked it, and neither
above nor below was there a sign of any other person in the house. All
I had seen was walls, without chairs or table, or even a chest, like
that of the rats and snake. It was like a house bewitched. At this
juncture he said to me, “You, my boy! have you eaten?” “No, sir,” said
I, “for it was not eight o’clock when I met your worship.” “Well,” he
said, “although I have breakfasted this morning, I shall be fasting
until night, so you must hold on, and afterwards we will have supper.”
<span class="sidenote">Lazaro sees<br/>trouble ahead<br/>about food, but<br/>he
dissimulates.</span>When I heard this I was very much depressed, not so
much from hunger, as from the knowledge that the luck was continuing
to be against me. For my hardships seemed to be coming back. I mourned
over my troubles, and remembered what I once thought, when I was
meditating on leaving the priest, that ill-fortune might bring me to
something worse. Finally, I began to weep over my miserable past life,
and over my approaching death. At the same time I dissimulated as well
as I could.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[p. 53]</span></p>
<p>“Sir,” I said, “I am a boy who does not trouble much about eating,
blessed be God! So that I am able to receive praise among all my
equals, as the one who has the most moderate appetite, and for this I
have even been praised, up to this time, by my former masters.” “This
is a virtue,” he replied, “and for this I like you better. Gluttony is
for pigs and to eat with moderation for respectable people.” “Well do
I understand you,” said I to myself, “and cursed be such medicine, and
such kindness as I have had from my masters, who give me nothing but
starvation.”</p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The esquire and<br/>Lazaro sup on<br/>the boy’s
three<br/>pieces of bread.</span>I then put myself in one corner of the
doorway, and took some pieces of bread out of my bosom, which remained
from what had been given me. When he saw it he said to me, “Come
here, my boy, what is it you are eating?” I came to him and showed
him. He took for himself the largest of the three pieces I had, and
said to me, “By my life! this bread seems good.” “And sir,” said I,
“it is good.” “Yes, by my faith!” said he, “where did you get it
from—are you sure it was kneaded with clean hands?” “I do not know
that,” said I, “but the smell of it does not turn my stomach.” “Please
God!” said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[p. 54]</span> my poor
master, and, putting it to his mouth, he began to take as voracious
mouthfuls as I did with mine. “It is most delicious,” he said. I feared
he would finish first, and that he would want to help me with what
was left of mine, so we both came to an end at the same time. <span class="sidenote">A meagre supper<br/>and a wretched<br/>bed.</span>My master
then began to collect with his hand a few crumbs which had remained
on our breasts. Then he went into a small room and brought out a jug
without a spout, and not very new. After he had had a drink he offered
it to me. I said, “Sir! I do not drink wine.” “It is water,” he
replied, “and you can well drink it.” Then I took the jug and drank,
but not very much, as thirst was not my complaint. So we remained until
the night, talking about things he had asked me, while I gave the best
answers I could.</p>
<p>He took me into the chamber out of which he had brought the jug
of water, and said, “Boy, stay here, and see how we make this bed,
that you may know how to make it henceforward.” He put me at one end
and himself at the other, and he made the miserable bed. There was
not much to make. He had a sort of hurdle on trestles. Over this he
spread clothes. They did not look very like a mattress, but served as
one, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[p. 55]</span> much less
blanket than was necessary. What there was we spread out, but it was
impossible to soften the bed. It was too hard.</p>
<p>When the bed was made, and the night being come, he said to me:
“Lazaro, it is now too late, it is a long way to the market-place,
and in this city there are many thieves who prowl about at night.
We must do the best we can, and to-morrow, when it is light, God
will have mercy. Being alone I am not provided, for I have been
in the habit of having my meals outside, but now we will arrange
things in another way.” <span class="sidenote">The esquire’s<br/>apology for<br/>no supper. His<br/> philosophical view<br/>of
starvation.</span> “Sir,” I replied, “do not trouble about me,
for I can pass a night like this.” “You will become more and more
healthy,” he then told me, “for there is nothing in the world that
lives long but it eats little.” “If that is so,” I said to myself, “I
shall never die, for I have always been obliged to observe that rule
by force, and even, if my ill-luck continues, it may be so all my
life.”</p>
<p>He lay down on the bed, using his hose and doublet for a pillow, and
ordered me to put myself at his feet. I did so, but not to go to sleep,
for the canes of the hurdle and my protruding bones struggled with each
other without ceasing. What with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[p.
56]</span> my hardships, misery, and starvation I do not think there
was a pound’s weight of flesh on my body. <span class="sidenote">A very
bad night.</span>As I had scarcely eaten anything all day I was wild
with hunger, which is not a friend of sleep. I cursed my fate and my
ill-luck a thousand times, may God pardon me! I was like that most of
the night, not daring to turn for fear of awakening my master; and I
prayed to God many times for death.</p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The esquire<br/>attends<br/>to his outward<br/>
appearance.</span>When morning came we got up and began to shake and
brush the doublet and hose, the coat and cloak. My master dressed
himself very carefully, combed his hair, washed his hands, and put his
sword on. As he did so he said to me: “Ah, my boy, if you only knew
what a weapon this sword is. There is not a mark of gold in the whole
world for which I would give it. Moreover, there is not a sword among
all that Antonio ever made that has the steel so tempered as this one.”
Then he drew it out and tried it with his finger, saying, “Look here,
I am obliged to use a ball of wool for it.” I said to myself, “And I
need a piece of bread for my teeth, though they are not made of steel.”
He put his sword back, and with a stately pace, his body erect, his
head turned gently from side to side, throwing <span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[p. 59]</span>the end of his cloak over his shoulder, and
putting his right hand on his side, he said, “Lazaro, take care of the
house, make the bed, fetch water from the river for the jug, as it is
getting low. I am going to hear Mass. Lock the door that nothing may be
stolen, placing the key on the hook by the hinge, that I may be able to
come in when I return.”</p>

<p class="mt1"><span class="sidenote">Stately<br/>appearance of the<br/>esquire
when he<br/>walked abroad.</span>He then marched down the street with such
a contained and noble air that any one who did not know the contrary
would have thought that he was a very near relation to the Count of
Arcos,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_25" id="FNanchor_25">[25]</a>
or at least his chamberlain who had been clothed by him. “A blessing on
you, my lord,” I was left saying, “who gives the disease and provides
the remedy.” Who would meet my master, and, judging from his satisfied
look, not suppose that he had supped well and slept in a comfortable
bed, and that in the morning he had had a good breakfast? <span class="sidenote">Lazaro’s<br/>reflections on<br/>the secrets hidden<br/>under the
<br/>esquire’s cloak.</span>Great secrets, sir, are those which you keep and
of which the world is ignorant.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[p.
60]</span> Who would not be deceived by that fair presence and decent
cloak? And who would think that the same gentleman passed all that day
without eating anything but the bit of bread which his servant Lazaro
had carried all day in his bosom, where it was not likely to find much
cleanliness? To-day, washing his hands and face, he had to wipe them
with the end of his cloak for want of a towel. Certainly no one would
have suspected it. O Lord! how many such as him must be scattered over
the world, who suffer for the jade they call honour that which they
would not suffer for a friend.</p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Lazaro’s<br/>reflections.<br/>He goes for water<br/>and
finds his<br/>master flirting<br/>on the river bank.</span>I was standing at
the door, looking out and thinking of these and many other things until
my master disappeared down the long and narrow street. Then I went back
into the house, and in the time that it would take to say a <i>credo</i>
I had run all over it without finding anything. I made the hard bed,
took up the jug and went with it to the river. There I saw my master
in great request with two fair ladies in a garden. There were other
ladies, for many think it fashionable to go and refresh themselves
on summer mornings by those pleasant banks. In confidence that they
will be well received, several gentlemen of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[p. 61]</span> place also frequent the river-side. As I
have said, my master was among them, saying the sweetest things that
Ovid ever wrote. They had no shame in asking him to pay for their
breakfasts, but he, finding that he was as cold in the purse as he was
empty in the stomach, began to have that feeling which robs the face
of its colour, and to make not very valid excuses. When they saw his
infirmity, they went to those who were not suffering from it. I was
breaking my fast with some stalks of vegetables with great diligence,
and not seeing any more of my master I went back to the house.</p>
<p>I thought of sweeping some part of it, which was very necessary,
but I could find nothing with which to do it; so I set myself to think
what I should do next. <span class="sidenote">Lazaro waits long<br/>for
his master<br/>to bring food, but<br/>he never came.</span>I thought I would
wait for my master until noon. When he came he might by good luck bring
something for us to eat. But there was no such experience for me. It
was two o’clock, my master had not come, and I was desperately hungry.
So I shut the door, put the key where I was told, and gave all my
attention to my own necessities.</p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Lazaro’s<br/>successful begging<br/>
expedition.</span>With a low and feeble voice, and my hands in
my bosom, the good God before my eyes, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[p. 62]</span> my tongue repeating His Name, I began to
pray for bread at the largest houses and doors I came upon. As this
method was sucked in with my mother’s milk, or I should say that I
learnt it from that great master of it, the blind man, so good a
disciple was I that, although in this city little is known of charity,
nor had it been an abundant year, I made such a good haul that, before
the clock struck four, I had several pounds of bread inside me, and two
loaves up my sleeve and in my bosom. I returned to the house, and, in
passing a tripe-shop, I begged of one of the shopwomen, who gave me a
piece of a cow’s foot and several pieces of boiled tripe.</p>
<p>When I got back to the house my good master was already there. The
cloak was folded and put on the bench, and he was pacing up and down.
He came up to me, and I thought he was going to scold me for being
late. He asked me where I had been, and I said, “Sir! I was here until
it struck two. But when I saw that you were not coming, I went over
the city, to commend myself to the kind people, and they have given me
what you see.” I showed him the bread and the tripe, which I carried in
the end of my skirt. At this he seemed well pleased and said, “Well, I
waited for you to eat, and when you did not <span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[p. 65]</span>come I ate what there was, but you have
done well in this, for it is better to beg in the name of God than to
steal. He helps me as He sees fit. <span class="sidenote">What touches
the<br/>esquire’s honour.</span>I merely charge you that people must not
be told that you live with me, for it touches my honour; though I well
believe that it will be kept secret, because very few people know me
here.”</p>

    “<i>Gave me a piece of a cow’s foot and several pieces of boiled tripe.</i>”
  </p>
</div>
<p class="mt1">“Do not be troubled about that, sir,“ I replied to him,
“for cursed be he who asks the question, and myself if I tell him
anything. No, we shall soon be free from want. When I saw that nothing
good came into this house I went out. Surely the ground must be bad, or
there must be unlucky houses which bring ill-luck to those who live in
them.” “This one must be so without doubt,” he replied. “I promise you
that after a month I will not stay in it, even if it is given me as my
own.”</p>
<p>I sat down at the end of the bench, and, that he might not take me
for a glutton, I said nothing about the meal. I began supper, and to
bite my bread and tripe. <span class="sidenote">The esquire longs<br/>for
a share of<br/>Lazaro’s supper.</span>Looking stealthily I saw that my
unhappy master could not take his eyes off my skirt, which served as a
plate. May God have as much pity for me as I had for him! I could feel
what he felt, and have been feeling so every day. I thought whether it
would be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[p. 66]</span> right for
me to invite him to share, for as he had told me that he had dined, he
might decline the invitation. Finally, I asked that sinner to help me
in my work, and to break his fast as he did the day before. He had a
better chance, the food being better and my hunger less. It pleased God
to comply with my wish, and I even think with his. For as he passed,
in walking up and down, he came to me and said: “I assure you, Lazaro,
that you have the best grace in eating that I ever saw in any one, and
that no one can see you doing it, without having a longing to eat, even
when he had no such longing before.” “The great longing that you have
makes you think my way of eating so beautiful,” I said to myself, “and
causes your wish to help me.”</p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Lazaro’s courtesy,<br/>tact, and
kindness.</span>He longed to join me, and I opened a way by saying,
“Sir, the good tools make the good craftsman. This bread is delicious,
and this cow’s foot is so well cooked and seasoned that there is no
one that would not be drawn to it by the smell alone.” “Cow’s foot,
is it?” he said. “Yes, sir!” “I tell you that is the best mouthful
in the world, there is not even a pheasant that is so good.” “Try
it, sir!” said I, “and see whether it is as good as you think.”
<span class="sidenote">Lazaro generously<br/>provides<br/>his master<br/>with a
supper.</span>I put on one side<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[p.
67]</span> the cow’s foot and three or four pieces of bread, and he sat
down by my side, and began to eat as if he would like to devour every
little bone. “This wonderful food is like a hotch-potch,” he said. “You
eat with the best kind of sauce,” I replied. “Before God,” said he,
“if I had known I would not have eaten a mouthful all day.” “Thus the
good years avenge me,” I said to myself. He asked me for the jug of
water, and I gave it to him just as I had brought it. My master had not
over-eaten, and it is a sign of this that there was no want of water.
We both drank, and went to bed in the same way as the night before,
well contented. To avoid prolixity I may say that the same thing went
on for the next eight or ten days.</p>
<p>In the mornings my master went out to take the air in the streets
with the same satisfied look, leaving poor Lazaro with the head of a
wolf. I often reflected on my misfortune that, escaping from the evil
masters I had served, and seeking to better myself, I should have
found one who not only did not maintain me, but whom I had to support.
With all that I liked him well enough, seeing that he could not do
better. My feeling was rather of sorrow than of enmity. Often I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[p. 68]</span> fared ill in bringing to
the house that with which he might be satisfied.</p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Lazaro examines<br/>the esquire’s<br/>clothes, and
<br/>finds nothing.</span>One morning the sad esquire got out of bed in his
shirt and went up to the roof of the house. I quickly searched the hose
and doublet at the head of the bed, and found a small purse of velvet,
but there had not been so much as a blanca in it for many a day. “This
man,” I said to myself, “is really poor, and cannot give what he has
not got. The avaricious blind man and the ill-conditioned clergyman,
may God reward them both! nearly killed me with hunger, the one with a
kiss on the hand, the other with a deceitful tongue. Those it is right
for me to detest, but for this poor man to have a tender feeling.”
God is my witness that even now when I meet with any one dressed
like this, and walking with the same pompous air, it makes me sad to
think that he might be suffering what I saw my poor master suffer.
<span class="sidenote">Lazaro has a<br/>kindly feeling for<br/>his third
master.</span>With all his poverty I liked serving him; but not the
other two masters. I only felt some discontent, for I should have liked
him not to be quite so proud, and to have lowered his pretensions just
a little when his necessities were so great. But it seems to me that it
is a well-established rule among such people to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[p. 69]</span> march with their caps well cocked, though
they have not a blanca to their names. The Lord have mercy on those who
have to die of this disease!</p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Begging<br/>prohibited.</span>I was in this
condition, passing the life I have described, when my ill-luck again
began to pursue me. In that land the year was one which only yielded a
bad harvest, so the municipal authorities resolved that all mendicants
should leave the town; with the addition that any who remained after
four days should be punished by whipping. Then the law took effect,
and there were processions of poor people being whipped down the four
streets.</p>
<p>This so frightened me that I did not dare to transgress by begging.
So you may imagine the abstinence of our house, and the sadness and
silence of its inmates. We were two or three days without eating a
mouthful or speaking a word. <span class="sidenote">Lazaro is kept<br/>
alive by some<br/>kind shop-girls.</span>Some young women, sewers of cotton
who made caps and lived near us, kept me alive, for I had made friends
with them. From the little they had, they gave me enough to keep body
and soul together. I was not so unhappy for myself as for my forlorn
master, who in eight days never ate a mouthful, at least in the house.
I do not know where he went or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[p.
70]</span> what he had to eat when he went out. I used to see him
come back at noon, walking along the street with dignified carriage,
thinner than a greyhound of good breed, and with regard to what touched
the nonsense he called honour, he brought a straw of which we had
not enough in the house. <span class="sidenote">Master and boy in<br/>a
miserable and<br/>starving condition.</span>Coming to the door he would
grind his teeth with nothing between them, complaining all the time
of his bad lodging and saying: “It is a bad thing to see, and a most
unlucky place to have to live in, and while we have to be here it will
always be wretchedly sad. We have got to endure it, but I wish that
this month was over, so that we might leave it.”</p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The esquire brings<br/>home a real, but<br/>bemoans
his fate.</span>Being in this miserable and starving condition, one
day, I know not through what good-fortune or chance, my poor master
became possessed of a real. He came to the house with it, as delighted
as if he had got all the riches of Venice, and smiling at me with a
very joyous expression, he said: “Take it, Lazaro, for God has at
length begun to open His hand. Go to the market for bread, meat, and
wine, for we will break the Devil’s eye. I would further have you to
know that I have taken another house, and that we shall not have to
be in this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[p. 71]</span> wretched
one for more than another month. May it be accursed, and he who placed
the first tile to build it! O Lord! how have I lived here! Scarcely a
drop of wine have I drunk nor a morsel of bread have I eaten, nor have
I ever had any rest here, and it looks so sad and forbidding. Go and
return quickly, for to-day we will eat like counts.”</p>
<p>I took the jug and the real, and giving speed to my feet, I began to
run up the street to the market, very joyful and contented. But of what
avail if evil fortune always brought anxiety with my joy. So it was on
this occasion.</p>
<p>As I ran up the street I was calculating how I could spend the money
to the best advantage and most profitably, giving thanks to God that
my master had got something to spend. <span class="sidenote">Terror
of Lazaro,<br/>thinking they were<br/>bringing a dead<br/>body to his
house.</span>Suddenly I met a funeral with many priests and mourners. I
got up against the wall to let them pass. Presently they came, one in
deep mourning, apparently the wife of the deceased, with other women.
She was crying with a loud voice and saying, “O my lord and husband,
whither are they taking you, to the sad and empty house, to the dark
and wretched place, to the house where there is nothing to eat and
drink.” When I heard this the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[p.
72]</span> heaven and earth seemed to be joined together. I exclaimed,
“O unhappy me! it is to our house that they are taking this dead body.”
I turned back, slipped through the crowd of people, and ran down the
street as fast as I could to our house. <span class="sidenote">Lazaro
bars the<br/>door to keep out<br/>the dead body.</span>When I got there I began
to close the door in great haste, calling on my master to come and
help, and to defend the entrance. He was rather surprised, thinking it
was something else, and said to me, “What is this, my boy, what are
you making a noise about, what are you doing, why are you shutting the
door in such a fury?” “Oh sir,” I cried, “they are bringing a dead body
here!” “How do you know?” he said. “I met it in the street,” I replied,
“and the dead man’s wife was crying and shouting, ‘My lord and husband,
whither do they take you, to the dark and dismal house, to the sad and
wretched place, to the house where they never eat nor drink.’ It must
be here, sir, that they are bringing it.” Certainly when my master
heard this, though he had no great reason to be merry, he laughed so
heartily that it was a long time before he could speak. By this time
I had got the beam across the door and put my shoulder against it, to
make it more secure.</p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Lazaro barring<br/>the door.</span>The people
passed with their corpse, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[p.
73]</span> all the time I pushed against the door, to prevent them from
getting into the house. At last, when he had had much more of laughing
than of eating, my good master said to me, “In truth, Lazaro, seeing
what the widow was saying, you were right to think as you did. But God
has been good to us, and they have passed. So open, open, and go and
get the food.” “Let me wait, sir, until they are out of the street,”
I begged. <span class="sidenote">At last the esquire<br/>unbars the door,<br/>
and Lazaro does<br/>his marketing.</span>At last my master came and opened
the door in spite of me, which was necessary, because I was so upset
with fear and excitement. I then went out. We ate well on that day, but
I took no pleasure in it, nor did my colour come back for three more
days, while my master smiled a good deal, whenever he noticed the state
I had been in.</p>
<p>In this way I continued with my third and poorest master, the
esquire, for several succeeding days, always longing to know the
reason of his coming and remaining in this place. For, from the first
day that I took service with him, I saw that he was a stranger,
from the little intercourse he had with the inhabitants. <span class="sidenote">The esquire<br/>tells his story<br/>to Lazaro.</span>At
last I accomplished my desire, and came to know what I wanted. It
was one day when we had eaten reasonably well,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[p. 74]</span> and were rather well satisfied. He told
me about his affairs, and said that he came from Old Castille. He
said he had left his home for no other reason than that he had not
taken off his cap to a knight who was his neighbour. “Sir,” I said,
“if that was what happened, and he was greater than you, were you not
wrong in not having doffed your cap first? but he ought to have taken
his off as well.” He went on to say that the knight did take off his
cap to him; but that he had taken his off first so many times, that
it was well to see what the other would do. “It seems to me, sir,”
said I, “that you should have doffed to one greater and richer than
yourself.” <span class="sidenote">The esquire<br/>expounds his<br/>views of
honour<br/>to Lazaro.</span>“You are only a boy,” he replied, “and cannot
understand the things appertaining to honour in which, at the present
time, is all the wealth of respectable people. You must remember that
I am, as you know, an esquire. I swear to God that if I met a count in
the street and he did not salute me, I would not salute him if I met
him again. I should enter some house as if I had business there, or
turn down another street before he came near me. For a gentleman owes
nothing to any one but God and the king; nor is it right for a man
of honour to forego his self<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[p.
75]</span>-respect. I remember that one day, in my country, I affronted
and nearly came to blows with an officer, because whenever I saluted
him he said, ‘May God preserve your honour!’ ‘You are a wretch,’ I
said, ‘for you are not well bred. You said to me “God preserve you,”
as if I was nobody.’ From that time he took off his cap, and behaved
properly.” <span class="sidenote">The esquire<br/>continues to<br/>discourse on
<br/>the same subject.</span>“Is it not good manners for one man to salute
another,” I asked, “or to say ‘God preserve you’?” He answered, “It
is only underbred people who talk thus. To gentlemen like myself, it
should be not less than ‘I kiss the hands of your honour!’ or at the
very least, ‘I kiss your hand, sir!’ if he who speaks is a knight. In
my own land I would not suffer a mere ‘God preserve you,’ nor will I
suffer it from any man in the world, from the king downwards.” “Sinner
that I am,” said I, “for having taken so little care about it. But will
you not suffer any one to pray for you?”</p>
<p>He continued: “Above all, I am not so poor but that I possess, in my
own country, an estate of houses which are well-built, sixteen leagues
from where I was born, in the vicinity of Valladolid. They would be
worth two hundred times a thousand maravedis if they were in good
repair; and I also have a pigeon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[p.
76]</span>-cote which, if it was not demolished, would give out two
hundred pigeons every year, as well as other things about which I am
silent, as it might touch my honour.</p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The esquire’s<br/>honour makes<br/>him fastidious<br/>in
accepting<br/>employment.</span>“I came to this city because I expected to
find a good appointment, but things have not turned out as I thought.
Canons and other Churchmen find plenty, because their profession is not
overcrowded. Careless gentlemen also seek me, but to serve with such
people involves great trouble, for a man must lose his self-respect
with them. If not they tell you to go in God’s name, while the pay is
usually at long intervals; when they wish to clear their consciences,
and pay for your work, they make you free of a wardrobe containing a
worn doublet and a frayed cloak. <span class="sidenote">Service with<br/>
a great lord is not<br/>to the esquire’s<br/>liking.</span>When a man takes
service with a titled lord there is also misery. I cannot undertake to
serve or content such. By the Lord! if I should engage myself to one,
I think that I should be a great favourite, and that he would confer
great favours on me; but I should have to like his habits and customs
though not the best in the world; I should be expected never to say a
word that would displease, to be very careful in word and deed, not
to kill myself in doing things<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[p.
77]</span> which the great man would not see, never to consort with
those who would do him disservice because it would behove me to guard
his interests. If some servant of his excites his anger by neglecting
his duties, and it should appear that something might be said for the
accused, on the contrary you must scoff at the poor fellow maliciously.
It is a duty to inform against those in the house, and to find out
what is done outside, so as to report it. Many other things of a like
kind are the custom in a palace, and with the lord of it, who appears
honourable. But such lords do not want to see virtuous men in their
houses. On the contrary, they hate and despise them, calling them
useless and unacquainted with business. I do not wish to trust my
fortunes with such people.”</p>
<p><span class="sidenote">When the people<br/>came for their<br/>rent, the
esquire<br/>disappeared.</span>In this way my master was lamenting his
ill-fortune, and giving me an account of his valorous person. While he
was thus employed a man and an old woman came in by the door. The man
asked for the rent of the house, and the old woman for the rent of the
bed, saying that they were hired from two months to two months. I think
the sum required was twelve to thirteen reals. My master gave them a
very civil answer, saying that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[p.
78]</span> he would go out and get change, and return in the
afternoon.</p>
<p>But his departure was without any return. They returned in the
afternoon when it was late, and I told them that he had not yet come
back. The night came, but he did not. I was afraid to stay in the house
alone, so I went to my girl-friends, told them what had happened, and
slept there. When morning came the creditors returned and asked for the
lodger. The girls answered that his boy was there, and that the key was
in the door. They asked me where my master was, and I answered that
I did not know where he was, but that he had gone out to get change.
I thought that he had gone with the change from me as well as from
them.</p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Creditors search<br/>for the esquire’s<br/>effects,
but<br/>there are none.</span>When they had heard what I had to say they
went for an officer and a scrivener. Presently they returned with
them. They took the key, called me and some witnesses, opened the door
and went in to take possession of my master’s effects until he had
paid his debts. They went all over the house and found it empty. Then
they asked me where my master’s effects were, his chest, clothes, and
jewelry. I said that I did not know. No doubt, they said, they have got
up in the night and taken <span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[p.
81]</span>them somewhere else. <span class="sidenote">Lazaro is taken<br/>
into custody.</span>“Sir,” they said to the officer, “take this boy
into custody, for he knows where the effects are.” On this the officer
came and took me by the collar, saying, “Boy, you are my prisoner if
you do not show us the goods of your master.”</p>

    “<i>They returned in the afternoon.</i>”
  </p>
</div>
<p class="mt1">I never was in such a plight as this, though I had been
taken by the collar many times. I was dreadfully frightened and began
to cry, promising to tell them all they might ask. “That is well,” they
said, “tell all you know and you have nothing to fear.”</p>
<p>The scrivener then sat down on the bench to write out the inventory,
asking me what there was. I said, “What my master has, according to
what he told me, is a very good estate consisting of houses and a
demolished pigeon-cote.” “This is worth little,” they said, “but it
will do for the payment of his debts. In what part of the town is
it?” “In his own country,” I replied. “By the Lord! this is a fine
business,” they exclaimed, “and where is his country?” “He told me that
it was in Old Castille,” I said. The officer and the scrivener laughed
a good deal, and said, “This is a good story to cover your debts!”</p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Lazaro is released,<br/>at the intercession<br/>
of his girl-friends.</span>The girls who were my neighbours, and
who were present, then said: “Sirs! this is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[p. 82]</span> an innocent child, and has only been a few
days with that esquire, and knows no more than your worships. He used
to come to our house and we gave him to eat what we could spare, for
the love of God, and at night he went to sleep with the esquire.”</p>
<p>Seeing that I was innocent they let me go. Then the officer and the
scrivener asked for their fees from the man and the old woman, over
which there was much contention and noise. They declared that they
ought not to be forced to pay, for they had got nothing to pay with,
and that the seizure of goods had not been made. The others maintained
that they had been taken away from other business of more consequence.
Finally, after making a great noise, they went away, and I do not know
how it ended.</p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Lazaro finds<br/>himself deserted<br/>by his

employment. Thus I left my poor third master, and know not his unhappy
fate. Looking back at all that had gone against me, I found that I had
managed my affairs in a reverse way. Masters are usually deserted by
their boys, but with me it was not so. For my master deserted and fled
from me.</p>

<p class="ti0"><span class="smcap">I had</span> to seek for my fourth

by my girl-friends. They called him a relation. He was a great enemy
of the choir, and of having his meals in the convent. He was fond of
walking about, of secular business, and of paying visits, so much so
that I think he wore out more shoes than any one else in the convent.
The friar gave me the first shoes I ever burst in my life. They did
not last eight days. I could not endure so much trotting about. For
this reason, and some other little things I will not mention, I left

<h2 class="nobreak">FIFTH MASTER</h2>
<p class="subh2">HOW LAZARO TOOK SERVICE WITH A SELLER OF PAPAL INDULGENCES</p>
</div>
<p class="ti0"><span class="smcap">My fifth</span> master chanced to
be a man engaged in the sale of Papal Indulgences.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_26" id="FNanchor_26">[26]</a> He was the most
shameless and impudent distributor of them that ever I saw or hope to
see, nor do I believe that any one else ever saw one like him. For
he had and sought out his own modes and methods, and very cunning
inventions. Coming to the place where he wanted to effect the sales,
he began by making trifling presents to the clergy, but nothing of
any great value: a lettuce of Murcia if it was the season, a couple
of lemons or oranges, a peach, a couple of nectarines, or some green
pears. In this way he got them into good humour for favouring his
business, and inducing their parishioners to buy his Indulgences.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[p. 85]</span></p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Subtle<br/>contrivances<br/>of the seller<br/>of
Indulgences.</span>If they said that they understood Latin, he did not
say a word in that language, for fear of stumbling, but he resorted
a gentle and well-considered way of telling his story, with a most
seductive tongue. If he found that the clergy were of the reverend
class, he talked to them in Latin for two hours, at least what appeared
like Latin, though it might not have been so. When the people did
not buy the Indulgences freely, he sought how to make them do so by
bringing trouble on their village. At other times he tried cunning
tricks. But as all his devices would take long to relate, I will only
recount one that was specially subtle, and proved his sufficiency.</p>
<p>He had preached for two or three days in a village near Toledo,
using all his accustomed arts, but no one had bought an Indulgence, nor
was there any sign of an intention to do so. He had devoted them all
to the Devil, and was meditating what to do next, when he determined
to call the parishioners together the next morning and make a last
effort. <span class="sidenote">Sham quarrel<br/>between the seller<br/>of
Indulgences<br/>and the constable.</span>That night he and the constable,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_27" id="FNanchor_27">[27]</a> after
supper,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[p. 86]</span> sat down
to play at cards, and they began to quarrel over the game, and make
use of bad language. The seller of Indulgences called the constable
a thief, and the constable called him a liar. On this my master took
up a lance which was in the doorway. The constable put his hand on
his sword. At the row they were making the guests and neighbours came
and got between them. In great fury the combatants struggled to free
themselves and get at each other. But as the place was full of people
they saw that they would be prevented from fighting, so they again
resorted to abusive language. Among other things the constable said to
my master that he was a liar, and that the Indulgences about which he
preached were false. At last the people, as they could not pacify the
disputants, determined to take the constable away. Thus my master was
left in a great rage. Later on the guests and neighbours entreated him
to moderate his anger and go to bed, which in the end we all did.</p>
<p>When morning came my master went to the church to arrange about the
Mass, and about preaching the sermon to announce the Indulgences. The
people assembled, but they came murmuring at the Indulgences,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[p. 87]</span> saying that they
were false, and that the constable himself had found it out. If
before they disliked buying them they now detested the idea. <span class="sidenote">The seller<br/>of Indulgences<br/>begins his sermon.</span>The
commissary or seller of Indulgences went up into the pulpit, and began
his sermon by urging the people not to fail in getting the benefit
of such a blessing and such Indulgences as the sacred Bull brought
them. When he was in the middle of his sermon the constable entered
by the door of the church, and when he had said a prayer, he got up
and addressed the people in a loud voice. “Good people,” he said,
“hear one word from me, and then listen to any one you like. I came
here with this cheat who is preaching to you, and he deceived me. He
said that I should help him in this business, and that we would divide
the profits. Now see the harm he would have done to my conscience
and to your pockets. <span class="sidenote">Sham<br/>denunciation<br/>of the
Indulgences<br/>by the constable.</span>I plainly declare to you that the
Indulgences he is preaching about are false, and that you should not
believe in them nor buy them. I will not be a party to it, directly nor
indirectly. From this time I give up the wand of office and put it on
the ground. If hereafter this man is punished for his falsehoods, you
must be my witness that I am not a party to them,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[p. 88]</span> and have neither aided nor abetted them. On
the contrary, I have undeceived you and exposed his imposture.” Then he
concluded his speech.</p>
<p>Some respectable men wanted to take the constable and turn him out
of the church to avoid scandal. But my master raised his hand and
ordered that no one should molest him on pain of excommunication. He
declared that the constable must be allowed to say whatever he liked.
When the constable had finished, my master asked him whether he wanted
to say anything more. The constable replied, “I could say a good deal
more about your falsehoods, but this will do for the present.”</p>
<p>The commissary then knelt down in the pulpit, clasped his hands,
turned his eyes up, and said: “O Lord! from whom nothing is hidden, and
to whom all things are known, to whom nothing is impossible but all
things are possible, Thou knowest the truth and how unjustly I have
been accused. All that concerns myself I freely pardon, as Thou, Lord,
hast pardoned me. Look not at this man who knows not what he does or
says. I only pray for justice. Some who are present may perchance have
intended to take these holy Indulgences, and on hearing the false words
of that man they may have changed their minds.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[p. 89]</span> So I pray to Thee, O Lord, that Thou wilt
work a miracle in this way. <span class="sidenote">Sham miracle<br/>worked
on<br/>the constable.</span>If what my accuser says is true, that I am
evil and false, let this pulpit sink from me forty feet under ground,
and never appear again. But if what I say is true, and that man is
persuaded by the Devil to try to deprive those present of such great
benefits, let him be punished, that all may know his malice.”</p>
<p>Scarcely had my devout master finished his speech when the bad
constable fell to the ground with such a noise that the church
resounded. Then he began to groan and foam at the mouth, making hideous
faces, throwing about his arms and legs, and rolling about on the
ground. The noise made by the people was so great that they could not
hear each other speak. Some were astounded and terrified. Others cried
to God for help. A few, not without trepidation, took his arms and held
his legs, for there is not a mule in the world that could have given
fiercer kicks. So they held him for a long time, there being more than
fifteen men keeping him down, and to all he gave blows, and, if they
were not careful, kicks also.</p>
<p>All this time my master was on his knees in the pulpit, with hands
and eyes raised to heaven, transported by the divine essence.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[p. 90]</span> The noise and disturbance
in the church had no effect on his sacred contemplations. <span class="sidenote">The people<br/>intercede for<br/>the constable.</span>Some
good men came to him, and, speaking loudly to arouse him, entreated him
to succour that poor creature who was dying. They besought him not to
dwell upon things that were past, and not to consider his evil deeds,
as he had been punished. They prayed to him that, if he could do any
good, he would deliver the man from his sufferings for the love of
God. They declared that they clearly saw the sin of the culprit, and
my master’s truth and goodness, but entreated him to pray to the Lord
not to prolong the man’s punishment. <span class="sidenote">All the
people<br/>pray for<br/>the constable<br/>to be forgiven.</span>The commissary,
like one awaking from a delicious dream, looking long at the culprit
and at those who were round him, then said: “My good friends, you have
interceded for a man on whom God has so signally laid his Hands. But He
has enjoined us not to return evil for evil, and to pardon injuries. We
may confidently pray that His goodness will pardon this offender who
has tried to put obstacles into the working of His holy faith. Let us
all pray for this.”</p>
<p>He then came down from the pulpit, and desired that all should
pray very devoutly to our Lord to pardon that sinner, and restore
him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[p. 91]</span> to health and
sound judgment, delivering him from the Devil, if, for his great sin,
the Evil One had been permitted to enter into him. All went down
on their knees before the altar, while the clergy began to chant a
litany in a low voice, coming with a cross and the holy water, after
singing over it. My master raised his hands to heaven, and turned his
eyes up until scarcely anything could be seen but the whites. <span class="sidenote">The farce<br/>is carried on<br/>to completion.</span>He then
commenced an address not less long than devout, which made the people
weep as they do over a sermon on the Passion delivered by a famous
preacher. He prayed to the Lord not to require the death of the sinner,
but rather to give his life back to one who had been led away by the
Devil, that, being convinced of his sin unto death, he might receive
pardon, life, and health, and that he might repent and confess. This
done, he would receive the Indulgence.</p>
<p>Presently the sinful constable began gradually to recover until
he was himself again. When he was well, he fell at the feet of the
commissary asking for pardon, and confessing that what he had said
was by order of the Devil, to do my master harm and to be avenged on
him, but principally because the Devil was very much annoyed at the
good that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[p. 92]</span> was done
by the Indulgences being received. My master pardoned him, and signs
of friendship were passed between them. Then there was such eagerness
to buy the Indulgences that scarcely a soul in the place was without
one—husbands and wives, sons and daughters, boys and girls. The news
of what had happened soon spread to the neighbouring villages, and
when we came to them it was not necessary to preach nor even to go to
church. In ten or twelve villages of that neighbourhood where we were,
my master sold as many thousand Indulgences, without having to preach
a single sermon. When he performed this farce, I confess that I was
astounded and believed like many others. <span class="sidenote">Lazaro
was<br/>behind the scenes.</span>But afterwards I was a witness to the
jokes and laughter that my master and the constable had over the
business. I knew how it had been planned and arranged by the industry
and inventive talent of my master. Though only a boy I fell into
thought, and said to myself, “How many more tricks will the rogues
play on these innocent people!” I was nearly four months with my fifth
master, during which I also suffered plenty of hardships.</p>

</div>
<p class="ti0"><span class="smcap">After this</span> I took service
with a master who painted tumbrels. My duty was to grind the colours,
and here also I suffered many evil things. Having now grown to be a
fine lad, I went into the principal church, and one of the chaplains
took me to be his servant. He gave me charge of a donkey, four jars,
and a whip. So I began to carry water for the city. This was the first
step I ascended, to reach a decent life. For I gave thirty maravedis
of profit to my master every day, and on Saturdays I was allowed the
profits for myself, and everything else beyond the thirty maravedis
a day. I went on so well that at the end of four years I had put
something by, and was able to dress myself very well. I bought a
doublet of fustian, a coat with sleeves, and a woollen cloak, as well
as a sword. Shortly I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[p. 96]</span>
saw myself clothed like a respectable man. I said to my master that he
might take the donkey, as I did not intend to follow that occupation
any longer.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">SEVENTH MASTER</h2>
<p class="subh2">HOW LAZARO TOOK SERVICE WITH A CONSTABLE AND WHAT
    HAPPENED AFTERWARDS</p>
</div>
<p class="ti0"><span class="smcap">Having</span> taken leave of the
chaplain, I entered the service of a constable, but stayed a very
short time with him, for my occupation appeared to me to be dangerous,
especially one night when we were attacked with stones and sticks. They
treated my master badly, but they could not catch me. This business
made me retire from the constable’s service.</p>
<p>Thinking how I should live so as to find some rest and save a
little for my old age, it pleased God to enlighten me, and to put
me on a profitable road. With the favour of friends and patrons all
my labours and hardships, up to that time, were repaid, on reaching
what I sought and obtained. <span class="sidenote">Lazaro gets<br/>a
Government<br/>appointment,<br/>and is married.</span>This was a Government
appointment such as enabled no one to thrive except those who occupied
it. In it I live and reside to this day, in the service of God and
your Honour.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[p. 98]</span> My
duty is to have charge of the inspection of wine that is sold in this
city, as well at public sales as elsewhere, also to accompany those
who are condemned for default, and to cry out their transgressions,
being a crier speaking in good Castilian. It has happened also that
almost everything appertaining to the office passes through my hands,
throughout the whole city. He who wants to draw wine for sale may
reckon on deriving little profit, unless Lazaro de Tormes is consulted
in the matter.</p>
<p>At this time his Honour the Archpriest of St. Saviour’s,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_28" id="FNanchor_28">[28]</a> my lord
and the friend of your worship, seeing my cleverness and noticing my
presentable appearance when employed by him in announcing his wines,
made an arrangement that I should marry one of his servant girls.
Seeing myself that this would bring me benefits and favours, I gave my
consent. I was married to her, and to this day I have had no reason
to repent it, for I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[p. 99]</span>
found her to be a good girl and diligent in service. I have favour and
help from my lord the Archpriest. He always gives us during the year a
load of wheat, meat on festivals, sometimes loaves of fine bread, and
the shoes he has left off wearing. He arranged for us to rent a small
house near his own. On almost every Sunday and on feast days we dine in
his house.</p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Evil tongues.</span>But evil tongues are
never wanting, and never let people live in peace. They said I know
not what about my wife, because she went to make the bed and cook the
dinner, and in this they spoke the truth, but she was not a woman who
would give occasion for their scoffing. My lord the Archpriest had
promised what I think he will perform, and one day he spoke to me fully
on the subject. “Lazaro de Tormes,” he said, “he who listens to evil
tongues will never prosper. I say this because your wife may be seen
entering my house and leaving it. She comes with honour to herself and
to you, and this I promise you. Do not attend to what they say, and
be assured that what I tell you is for your good.” I replied that I
was determined to care for and preserve my honesty. “It is true,” I
said, “that some of my friends have spoken to me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[p. 100]</span> about this, and have even certified to me
that before I was married to my wife she had borne a child three times,
speaking with reverence to your Worship.” My wife took such oaths on
the subject that I thought the house would come down upon us, and then
she began to weep and to curse the day she had married me. She went on
in such a way that I wished I had died before I let such words out of
my mouth.</p>
<div class="figcenter mt1" id="p101" role="figure" aria-labelledby="ebm_caption9">

    “<i>But evil tongues are never wanting.</i>”
  </p>
</div>
<p class="mt1">I on one side and the Archpriest on the other
entreated her to leave off crying, and I swore that never in all my
life would I refer to the matter again. I declared that I should
rejoice to see her go in and out of our patron’s house whenever she
liked, as I was convinced of her honesty. <span class="sidenote">A
good<br/>understanding.</span>So we all three continued to have a good
understanding as to this, and have never heard more about it. When
any one tries to say anything I stop him by saying: “Look here! if
you are a friend do not say anything that will annoy me, for I do not
look upon him as my friend who causes me sorrow, more especially if he
tries to make trouble between me and my wife, for she is the thing in
the world that I care for most. I love her, and may God show favour to
her. She is a far better wife than I deserve, and I swear before the
consecrated host that she is as good a woman <span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[p. 103]</span>as can be found within the gates of
Toledo. He who says the contrary shall answer to me for it.” By this
means I manage that they shall say nothing, and I have peace in my
house.</p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Conclusion.</span>This was in the same year
that our victorious Emperor entered into this famous city of Toledo,
and held the Cortes here,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_29" id="FNanchor_29">[29]</a> and there were great rejoicings as your
Worship will have heard. At this time I was prosperous and at the
summit of all good fortune.</p>

<p class="mt1">Southern Spain or Andalusia is a subject <i>par
excellence</i> for a “colour book.” The names of Seville, Cordova,
Granada, and Cadiz awaken at once visions of the romantic South, of
white dazzling cities, of castle-crowned heights, of Christian Knights
battling with the Infidels. Above all is Andalusia precious to the art
lover as containing those marvellous monuments of vanished Moorish
civilisation, the Alhambra, the Alcazar, and the great Mosque of the
West. The present work vividly portrays its glories and beauties, and
is intended primarily as a souvenir and record for those who have
visited the country and wish to re-create their impressions. It will
also be welcomed by those unable to visit the places described, as it
will help them to realise, if only at second hand, some of its magic
charm.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p id="Footnote_10"><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_10" class="pginternal">[10]</a></span> The river Tormes rises in the
Sierra de Gredos, a range of hills dividing Estremadura from Old
Castille, on the confines of the province of Avila. Its chief sources
are a large sheet of water called the “Laguna de Gredos,” and a
perennial stream called “Tornella.” Receiving several streams from the
Gredos hills, the Tormes flows north, passing by Alba de Tormes, where
there is a stone bridge; and then turns north-west, passing Salamanca,
where there is another fine stone bridge, and Ledesma. Finally, it
falls into the Douro, on the Portuguese frontier. The Tormes turns many
flour mills.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p id="Footnote_11"><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_11" class="pginternal">[11]</a></span> This expedition against the Moors
started from Malaga under the command of Don Garcia de Toledo in 1510,
when Lazarillo was seven years old. The fleet first touched at Sicily
and then made for the island of Los Gelves, off the African coast,
between Tunis and Tripoli, now called Zerbi. With Toledo were Diego
de Vera and Count Pedro Navarro. Zerbi was a low sandy island covered
with palm-trees, ruled by a Sheikh of its own. The army landed on the
8th of August 1510. But the Spaniards fell into an ambuscade and were
defeated, Toledo being among the slain. Four thousand were killed or
taken prisoners. The rest escaped to the ships and returned to Sicily.
Toledo was a grandson of the first Duke of Alva.</p>

rudely carved in the shape of an animal, which had been on the bridge
from time immemorial; and which Lazarillo thought was like a bull. Its
great weight was considered a danger, and it was removed about thirty
years ago. It is now in the vestibule of the cloister of San Domingo at
Salamanca, but without a head.</p>

so called from the whiteness of the metal of which it was made. In the
time of Alonso XI. there were three blancas to the maravedi. From 1497
the maravedi was worth two blancas. The great dictionary of the Spanish
Academy quotes <i>Lazarillo de Tormes</i> as the authority for the value of
the blanca and half blanca, or farthing.</p>

<p id="Footnote_16"><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_16" class="pginternal">[16]</a></span> Almorox is a village with three
hundred houses formed in irregular streets and an open square. The
church of San Cristoval has a fine north door. The place belonged to
the Duke of Escalona. Its vineyards produce wine like Valdepeñas. It is
about twelve miles from the town of Escalona.</p>
</div>
<div class="footnote">
<p id="Footnote_17"><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_17" class="pginternal">[17]</a></span> The Duke of Escalona was the
maternal grandfather of the author. The town of Escalona is on the
right bank of the river Alberche, and about one hundred feet above it.
Escalona is twenty-five miles north-west of Toledo. It was surrounded
by a wall ten feet thick and thirty feet high, with two gates. In the
principal square there were arcades and a stone cross. Juan II. gave
Escalona to the Constable Alvaro de Luna in 1424, who built a great
palace there, which was demolished by the French under Marshal Soult.
King Henry IV. gave Escalona to Juan Pacheco, the Master of Santiago.
In Lazarillo’s time it belonged to Don Diego Lopez de Pacheco, second
Duke of Escalona and Marquis of Villena. He distinguished himself in
the last Moorish war in Granada, and died in 1529. He resided in the
old palace built by the Constable Alvaro de Luna, where he dispensed
hospitality, among many others to Don Alonzo Enriquez de Guzman (see
translation of that young adventurer’s life and acts, p. 71, Hakluyt
Society, 1862). Madoz states that, in his time, Escalona consisted of
190 houses, population 580.</p>

<p id="Footnote_21"><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_21" class="pginternal">[21]</a></span> Torrijos is sixteen miles
north-west of Toledo, and eight miles from the Tagus, in a valley on
the road from Maqueda to Toledo. It was walled, and still has two old
gateways. Madoz gives it 480 houses, and in the plaza is the palace of
the Count of Altamira, built of stone. The church is dedicated to San
Gil. Here Beatriz, the daughter of King Pedro by Maria de Padilla, was
born in 1353. The country round yields abundant oil, and the place is
sometimes called Torrijos de los Olivares.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p id="Footnote_22"><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_22" class="pginternal">[22]</a></span> Maqueda is six leagues north-west
of Toledo, built on a hill, on the margin of a stream of the same name
which falls into the Alberche, a tributary of the Tagus. It has 112
houses, scattered along badly paved dirty streets. There is an old
castle, and two churches, San Juan Bautista and San Domingo. Water is
abundant. Maqueda was taken from the Moors by Alfonso VI. in 1083,
and in 1177 it was granted to the knights of Calatrava. Ferdinand and
Isabella made Diego de Cardenas Duke of Maqueda.</p>

nobleman. The title belonged to the family of Ponce de Leon, but before
this was written the head of the family had become Duke of Cadiz, a
title which was afterwards changed to that of Duke of Arcos. The second
Duke was flourishing at this time, and died in 1590. Count, in the
text, is a mistake. It should be Duke.</p>

<p id="Footnote_28"><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_28" class="pginternal">[28]</a></span> Formerly there were two kinds of
parishes in Toledo. Those of the <i>Muzarabes</i>, founded by the Gothic
King Athanagild, the grandfather of St. Ildefonso, continued through
Moorish times. They were existing when Alfonso VI. took Toledo in 1085.
Their number was six, reduced to two. The others were called <i>Latinas</i>,
formed afterwards, of which there were twenty reduced to nine. St.
Saviour’s was one of the latter. It has been joined to that of San
Pedro since Lazarillo’s time.</p>

I. arrived as a prisoner at Madrid, Charles held a General Cortes
of Castille at Toledo. There were present most of the Grandees, and
all the foreign Ambassadors. The Viceroy Carlos de Lannoy arrived at
Toledo, and was cordially received by the Emperor, after having brought
Francis to Madrid. The Cortes petitioned Charles to marry Isabel, the
Infanta of Portugal; while the English Ambassadors proposed to him his
cousin, Mary Tudor. The Cortes sat until the end of August.—<i>Sandoval</i>,
